"@goatapp hey guys, trying to get my seller profile approved. Been over a week. Submitted a ticket but have heard nothing. What should I do next?"
"Commande passée 16 nov, Noel dans 18j vos mamans sérieux à gâcher mes plans. @goatapp"
@Shop_Swoosh @goatapp Wow! Awesome shoes
@JasonsJigs @goatapp @stockx Facts. Stockx is paralysed
@goatapp is there a reason you don’t have the GS Doernbecher sizes on the app?  We need them asap.
@goatapp I️ need help
@JasonsJigs @goatapp is the 🐐
@goatapp how long does it take for a sale to get reviewed and posted? I’ve been waiting over a week.
@23Bred @_Cop_Em @Shiekh @UPSHelp @UPS @goatapp @stockx Damn that's fukd..I got my kaws 4 coming in hope they don't get damaged
@goatapp Do you ship to the UK?! And how much is shipping?!
@SoleVaderr @goatapp @goatsupport Agree 💯
@goatapp @goatsupport Points don't mean anything after 150. I could basically cancel the next 100 orders and be fine. Time to implement a new reward system involving seller ratings.
Shouts out to @stockx @joshluber for actually verifying the Js i bought were fake and for the immediate refund and not making me jump through hoops to get my money back like @goatapp did. #trusted
@JasonsJigs @goatapp @stockx And @UPS lol
Same problem with @goatapp https://t.co/jbNCW8FXmi
@_Cop_Em @Shiekh @UPSHelp See what @ups doing ☝🏽 STOP using them ASAP @goatapp @stockx

"Finally made  my first sale through @goatapp, super easy and legit! #resalemadeeasy"
@goatapp hey if I buy a pair of shoes from you and something goes wrong. What’s your refund process??
"@goatapp going above and beyond for both buyers and sellers goes a long way, especially during times like these. Huge point of differentiation also if you go through with it"
"Hey @goatapp , take a page out of Marriott's marketing book and go charter a few vehicles to the Secaucus distribution center to pick up these orders"
Anyone know how long it takes for them to review a sale on @goatapp  @goatsupport ?
Shout out @goatapp https://t.co/6wR0MP0WCd
@saevaebruta @Danimal1124 @stockx @goatapp I’m glad I’m not the only one who thinks it’s a bad idea!  We are a culture of debt and companies are just adding to the problem

@goatapp trying to sell shoes through your app but never got the USPS label to ship to you - help?
@goatsupport @goatapp need yall to add the DB retro 12 in GS sizes on your platform
@goatapp Where within your app can you see sold listings all I can ever see are the asks. https://t.co/QyaArxplx9
@goatapp Do you ship to puerto rico?
@goatapp Can you disable no-picture listing because people are just manipulating prices and fucking over resell value. People are just undercutting the fuck out of people and messing with the price. You're losing money due to this and so are legitimate sellers.
@goatapp Possible security issue to report. Can you DM?
Clutch! make it permanent @goatapp https://t.co/jCqtsEbr4D

#sneakers #kicks"
@goatapp @goatsupport I have an order that seems to have slipped through the cracks. You have it been it hasn’t been authenticated. I opened a ticket in app but haven’t heard back. Please help!
@goatapp ...purchased numerous sneakers through you guys and I am now severely disappointed in your customer service after my most recent order. The seller is irresponsible and goat is leaving my inquiries unanswered.
"@goatapp if the person who accepted my offer qbd they never ship it off to y’all , when do i get my money back?"
"@zZackery_ @goatapp i got them, i also got proof

@goatapp Says buyer cancelled but I already shipped &amp; so how am I getting the money?? I already emailed!
@DonKickzPR @goatapp @stockx @UPS why?
@AnbNoob @goatapp @goatsupport Nah you're shmoney
@goatapp @stockx PLEASE Stop Doing Business With @UPS
AUTHENTIC MY SHIT @goatapp
@goatapp anyway I can get verified? It’s been well over a month. What do I need to do?
Great @GoatApp Weekend 👟 👟 👟 👟 👟 https://t.co/GKafHqeaj5
@AnbNoob @goatapp @goatsupport That box is fine.
Hey guys I dont know why but my order was canceled. I never received the package the bank debited my account but the app say I own the shoes 🤦🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️  @goatapp https://t.co/fIS6cpPMFm
@StayLOHAD @goatapp They cancelled after they confirmed shipment??
"@goatapp GOAT WTF MAN I dropped my packages off at ups and you cancelled my orders, UPS has crazy delays how is that my fault? DM ME NOW!!!!"
"@goatapp, do you have a customer service phone number? I submitted an issue via the app, but have yet to receive a response back. Thanks!"
@_TheGreatDV8_ @goatapp Why are you bullying me
@goatapp Can you please approve my seller request?
I used to brag about @stockx with how fast they authenticated but they have seriously dropped the ball. Now officially way slower then @goatapp 😔
"@soleheatonfeet @goatapp I think it’s UPS, not so much GOAT. I’ve shipped 6 pairs to GOAT and all delayed. I personally shipped one to a customer and same result"
@goatapp how do I get my sold item prepaid labels from behind USPS? I want to ship all my product to you guys with UPS.
@lolAnimated @goatapp what a fucking steal for some swag nasty shoes!
@goatsupport @goatapp No response or email ? Still waiting...
@goatapp Why does it take forever for you guys to answer an email or ticket !!
@mattypork @goatapp Damn wth
@sotojose_13 @goatapp You just gotta spam their support. I had tickets that wasn’t answered for a little bit more than a week.
@goatapp Y’all plan on doing customer service today or naw lol
Check out my kicks for sale on @goatapp https://t.co/blJk8pNZlb
@_Cop_Em @UPS @stockx @goatapp Because they are stupid. its not a good answer but it's also not a wrong answer.
@The_MPire_ @UPS @stockx @goatapp CORRECT SMFH thing that I’m most pissed about that has made me even angerier is that my packages were already here in my city for 5 days sitting less than 30 min away &amp; wouldn’t let me pick up. WHY WOULD THEY REROUTE TO DALLAS WHICH IS 4 HOURS AWAY INSTEAD OF DELIVERING LOCAL?
"@_Cop_Em @UPS @stockx @goatapp Yup and their entire ""customer service"" department coukd be replaced by a looped recording of someone saying ""I'm sorry, I have literally less information than you about your package, bye"""
@The_MPire_ @UPS @stockx @goatapp THATS MY POINT EXACTLY! Dec for me as a business is my busiest month. I use USPS for outgoing ONLY w/very few short delays but a lot of my own vendors for our supplies &amp; inventory only offer UPS so if I can’t get things in I NEED I can’t get ANYTHING out to my own customers!
@_Cop_Em @UPS @stockx and @goatapp need USPS options. I've shipped like 3/4 days before Christmas and had no delays there. I shipped this shit in November and they're already delayed? How are they possibly going to handle the rest of the month?!
@Purely_Ant @goatapp @goatsupport open up a ticket in app they respond pretty quick
"@goatapp @goatsupport can you guys help me check a couple orders that you guys said payment wasn’t filled. I’m still getting notification to ship but I want to clarify with you guys first before shipping because if i do ship and it’s no good, you guys charge me $30 to ship back.."
@goatapp @goatsupport Help
@goatapp  I being charged close to 13% on the sale and 2.9% on the transfer? That's about 16%. Its suppose to be 9.5% on the sale and 2.9% on the transfers. Please advise. My rating is 334. Goat is not responsive through email. Please advise
"It’s funny how .@goatapp keeps sending me emails wanting me to continue to purchase from them, but have ignored my concerns &amp; refuse to admit on sending me damaged Yeezy’s! 

.@bbb_us should look into this matter

I think I should try .@stockx, they more reliable &amp; trustworthy?"
@goatapp ima need you guys to wake up and answer my support ticket from yesterday 😤
@stockx how can I cancel my order with you guys? I purchased a pair of off white 1’s. The service is slow. I would rather buy from @goatapp
@goatapp I cancelled some shoes I order and after 3 days still haven't gotten my refund

"@goatapp Hey guys. I emailed months ago, then again a few weeks ago to be cleared to sell on your app, but still have not been notified. I’m clearing out my closet, and have a handful of kicks I’d like to get rid of. What’s the holdup? https://t.co/CFlUHst9Fo"
@goatapp i need help selling in your app
@goatapp how can I request shoes be delivered via USPS?
@AYOT1FF @goatapp They are very slow at responding sadly
@goatapp @goatsupport what’s it gonna be with order 99448617??? I have sent you numerous e-mails regarding your obligation to cancel the order due to the seller’s inabillity to ship the shoes on time. My original 3-day offer is no longer valid &amp; the whole process is long overdue.
@goatapp How long does shipping taking?
@ArjayTV @goatapp I will be interested to get your experience. I have had a lot of luck on eBay. Curious to know what’s not so hot for you now.
"Listing 20+ pairs of kicks on @goatapp is no joke. I know so of you are pros, but I feel like I’m working an 8-5 today 😂"
@goatapp is anyone monitoring your emails? I’ve tried contacting support on a number of occasions but no response to date. Will provide order and ref #.
@joshluber @stockx @goatapp I appreciate your reply but doesn’t the seller have to ship out within a certain amount of days. Seems like the seller of my shoes didn’t ship out right away. Which delays the shoes getting to me. Just want my shoes. #frustrated
"@jkudashoe @stockx @goatapp This time of year everything is delayed - UPS, order processing, payouts, support emails &amp; Twitter replies. This sounds like a UPS issue. But everyone is working 24/7 (literally) to make sure every order &amp; customer is taken care of. We greatly appreciate your patience."
@SoleAngry @goatapp @goatsupport Welp
@sotojose_13 @goatapp @goatsupport U got*
"@sotojose_13 @goatapp @goatsupport Yeah I got a "" order issue """
@sotojose_13 @goatapp @goatsupport Lmfao they hooping in em right now
Anyone else having issues with slow delivery times for @stockx Placed two orders 1.5 weeks ago and shoes still haven’t made it to @stockx Maybe I should stick with @goatapp This wait time is unacceptable. Let’s see if I get before 3-4 weeks from order date @joshluber
@backstockhype @goatapp @goatsupport Wth lol mine got delivered yesterday but now credits don’t show up lol
@sotojose_13 @goatapp @goatsupport 99% of the time it is. Youre either gonna have to put them on consignment and wait months for it to sell or pay $30 to have teh shoes sent back
@sotojose_13 @goatapp @goatsupport Bruh had a shoe vanish from my credits to than go back and check on my orders. A whole 6 weeks went by I didn’t notice but otw to goat it got lost rather than say anything I had to escalate to claim. Within 2 days I got my money
@jirachidog @goatapp @goatsupport Let’s hope not lol got them from Nike
@sotojose_13 @goatapp @goatsupport RIP that means something is wrong with your shoe. good luck asfgsayufgkuasdfsa
Anyone ever have pending credits on @goatapp @goatsupport disappear/not show up in the credits section no more ?
@goatapp can you guys hook me up with the Yeezys 2.0 Beluga for $340. I rather spend my money with you guys then @stockx
@goatapp can y’all fix your want/own section on the app?? Low prices/ top offers are not matching/ accurate...
"@goatapp @goatsupport can you guys help me check a couple orders that you guys said payment wasn’t filled. I’m still getting notification to ship but I want to clarify with you guys first before shipping because if i do ship and it’s no good, you guys charge me $30 to ship back"
"@goatapp Your support page lists both help@airgoat.com and help@goat.com, which one should be used? Are they both monitored? I've sent an inquiry to the former address. Thanks."
"@sauce_twan @goatapp they have them authenticated and ready to ship, when I went on there was a pair in my size for the right price but the pair after it skyrocketed so it really depends on the price but they are always legit from goat, never had a single issue always very happy with them"
"@adonisjb22 @stockx @goatapp During busy season, yes"

Anybody remember last holiday season when @goatapp @goatsupport was behind 3 weeks of authenticating.
@goatapp how long until you approve me to start selling? Feels like it’s been a while since I submitted.
@adidasUS @nikestore @goatapp @stockx @Footaction @footlocker @champssports @Eastbay @Shiekh @ShoePalace etc PLEASE do NOT use @UPSHelp this holiday season or u will have a TON of unhappy furious customers contacting u with complaints about delays! @USPS &amp; @FedEx have NO delays! https://t.co/nXinZRpOaF
"@goatapp @goatsupport 
Please respond to my email I need my phone number changed"
@goatapp Are you guys having shipping issues?
@stockx @goatapp Thanks for the feed back
Before cancelling a sale @goatapp @goatsupport use to contact you to see what was going on and if by that day shipping wasn't updated they would cancel.
@goatapp @goatsupport Why would you cancel an order that has already been shipped? Not even the first time this happens.
got a nice assortment headed over to @goatapp 📦👟
@sebastiano511 @stockx @goatapp this is literally the same exact shit that is happening to me
@soleheatonfeet @goatapp  RIP for the holidays
@goatapp it’s been over 24 hours and no seller confirmation. Is my order going to be cancelled? I’ve contacted customer service twice with no replies what’s up?
@jirachidog @goatapp Lmaoooooo
@goatapp @goatsupport You really need to consider lowering seller fees for those with 250+ points. They are your most loyal customers and you need to show them that they are appreciated. Makes no sense.
@SoleVaderr @goatapp Damaged box. The issue wasn't even my fsult. It looks like someone punched the box
@WhoTrynaBot @goatapp I guess not
@jirachidog @goatapp What was the flaw?
@jirachidog @goatapp They don’t give them a time limit?
"@stockx @goatapp Now you people respond, literally sent you 6 emails yesterday and Thursday, then this jam Bitch just copy’s and pastes what’s on the stock x website and sends it to me, if you’re gonna say “fuck you” just say it."
"@stockx @goatapp It’s shit fym. I’ve been trying to place an order for months you people always flag my shit and I’ve missed out on shoes soooo many times now for this bull shit. And Jan, she works there. Shit, garbage employee! Fire her!"
Hey @goatapp can you tell this dude to hurry tf up and make a decision. It's been over 3 days https://t.co/wFSjFQ78j4

Shoutout to @goatapp for spotting a false post on their app. Bought a pair of pictured VNDS silver medal 2.0 when they arrived to goat it appears the seller wore them to the ground. Needless to say refund was requested. Back on the search for the 🥈🥈
shoutout my freshman tim for letting me know @goatapp got the steaks for soccer cleats 👀🔥⚽️
@mclarenx989 @goatapp No the sale goes to whoever listed at that price the most recent. So if you see you aren't lowest price then change and go up by 5 then come back and match their price and you will be lowest price
@mclarenx989 @goatapp @goatsupport 👆
@goatapp yo son what’s good? I been waiting on these 95s for a week and a half  .. y’all suppose to be the GOAT.. pull up with my joints my guy 😂

I fux with @goatapp 🤑
@goatapp has me spending money left and right 🤦🏽‍♂️
"Hey @goatapp common sense would say that if the shipping box arrives damaged, then perhaps the shipping company (@UPS) damaged the shoe box inside while transporting them. Thus sellers shouldn’t be liable for this. Just a logical thought."
@Starlin_knows @DevilZzZuk @KonugantiSahith @yeezybusta @stadiumgoods @goatapp @flightclub @stockx There is also noticeable glue marks

@Matt59393732 @Starlin_knows @KonugantiSahith @yeezybusta @stadiumgoods @goatapp @flightclub @stockx Fair enough
"@DevilZzZuk @Starlin_knows @KonugantiSahith @yeezybusta @stadiumgoods @goatapp @flightclub @stockx I mean they could be real, but looking at the pictures, the dip looks very deep but it could be that you have be wearing them, don’t take my word"
@Matt59393732 @Starlin_knows @KonugantiSahith @yeezybusta @stadiumgoods @goatapp @flightclub @stockx I’ve worn them since March and it’s a Size 10.5 US.

@goatapp are u a reliable source for shoes and do you deliver to the uk
"@DevilZzZuk @Starlin_knows @KonugantiSahith @yeezybusta @stadiumgoods @goatapp @flightclub @stockx I am no Yeezy Busta but the back looks a lot wider then other pictures, could be because they have been worn but i have heard to look at the back if they are narrow they are real if they aren’t narrow and very wide then they are fuck but I don’t know"

@Shop_Swoosh @goatapp this man cheated i bet he used one of those snake scripts ive been hearing about
@goatapp is there a reason you guys haven’t responded to anything in over 48hrs?
@harshp92 @stevecook @goatapp Definitely agree
@Starlin_knows @KonugantiSahith @yeezybusta @stadiumgoods @goatapp @flightclub @stockx Got them at retail and my god they got the lot! Would go back there to cop another for Beluga V2.
@DevilZzZuk @KonugantiSahith @yeezybusta I was comparing from mines got them all retail only place I trust for resell is @stadiumgoods @goatapp and @flightclub with they wild ass prices oh and @stockx sold couple things there myself. Wait on @yeezybusta to reply bro hopefully you good
"@SamSachan @rehath_1030 @flightclub @stockx @proverbnyc Reasons to sell on @goatapp or @stockx versus @flightclub... #1 fc takes 20% which is highest commission out of all 3. #2 fc controls pricing so no free market and their pricing formula is inconsistent and private. #3 other apps pay immediately, fc takes a week+ for payouts"
@stevecook @goatapp This might be an unpopular opninion but those are hideous
@goatapp what’s the hold up? It’s been a week and I still can’t post any kicks on the #GOATapp doesn’t take this long to get started on eBay or #StockX https://t.co/80qn7csvOH
@goatapp Is this for men? or women? https://t.co/4oUMxNyE06
@goatapp straight up not answering Tickets In the app
"@adambain @eddylu @goatapp You’re a fool. This company is a total SCAM!  They took my money, won’t respond, won’t confirm order. Are you f’ing serious Adam????"
@ATrainKickz @goatapp They’re thirsty for cash they miss the little rotating bar that allows them to do that
"A bit disappointed with GOAT, I submitted a request 5 days ago to get confirmed so I could sell some yeezys and didn’t get confirmed. Even sent two emails with no response. A good app but needs faster seller verifications. Still good for reselling. @goatapp @goatsupport"
@goatapp pay me
"@goatapp problems with your app. Usps labels never emailed and three emails sent to you with no response, and two tickets open. 25hrs now. Don’t want orders cancelled."
@goatapp thanks for ignoring me! Simply trying to resolve your mistake and get the shoes shipped out as I never got a label. This is fucked up
@official_kid_J @goatapp How?
Every time I lay in bed scrolling through @goatapp my bank account ends up taking a hit.
@goatapp Fuck yall yall fucked me over $225
"@stevecook @goatapp Those frozen yellow..🔥🔥🔥 and love the goat app, definitely something that sneaker heads needed."
@JCarlo2013 @goatapp Couple days at most
@goatapp hello..can you dm me plz
Please make a rule where people can only undercut once per hour per shoe @goatapp @stockx .  Everyone makes more money this way.  💸💵💰
@Shop_Swoosh @goatapp How do u check if u won
@stevecook @goatapp yeezys are cool but the offwhite collection is straight FIRE!!!
"Thank you @goatapp and @goatsupport  for fixing the delay. Within 30 minutes my package went from sitting still, to in transit after talking to you guys! Much appreciated 🤘🏼"
@goatapp What is wrong with your customer service I have sent a message and have not received any feedback and to top it all off you do not have a phone number for anyone to reach you
@_MichaelSherman @goatapp Just watch it LOL I think the directions are up on my Instagram too. Do you have Instagram?
"@stevecook @goatapp ""Here is how u enter"" links me to a 20m vlog COME ON STEVE 😤"
@BrandonLadick @stevecook @goatapp same
"@goatapp why do you have no cheap cash out option? I really don't see why I need to pay 30 dollars to cash out 1K. Yall should really consider offering an Ethereum or Litecoin cash out. It would be way cheaper and a hell of a lot faster, not to mention attract more sellers."
Made my first @stockx purchase today. Partially to compare it to @goatapp but mostly because of the $20 off. Let’s see what happens.
First time buying @goatapp  and I’m surprise on how fast they shipped like the app and I’ll be buying more sneakers in the future https://t.co/btvTDt28cd

"@theyeezymafia the 2.0’s are going for around 400 on the @goatapp if they lower a little more which they should, I would buy them for under 400"
@Bpfillherup @goatapp My sz large tnf from last year is a little big
i totally reccomend the @goatapp The most professional and legit app i’ve ever purchased things from. Plus I ordered 5 days ago and it’s getting delivered to my house in Canada today. Usually things take 5 days just to get to Canada. 10/10 experience 😊
Still waiting on that @goatapp promotion to withdraw my $10k.. been 2 years now and no promotion or discount for withdrawal like they promoted. 😕
@Shop_Swoosh @goatapp Glad to se someone won that raffle though nobody did lol

"@goatapp If I sell a shoe today, does today count as 1 of the 3 business days? What time is the cutoff? Thanks!"
@goatapp How long dose it take to get a shoe that is in consignment with you returned to seller ?
@goatapp may know of someone? https://t.co/DkDo6gk33G
"@ProudMoolie @goatapp @stockx My size, damn"
@vanessarodd @goatapp Thanks beautiful 😭💕

"I was about to buy Yeezy’s on @goatapp , somebody give me a fucking high five for self-control please"
@goatapp So disappointed in you guys. I've had a ticket open for almost a month and no one has responded. For shame...
@goatapp Help. Never received shipping label for shoes confirmed and sold. Don’t want to get penalized for shipping late. Please resend.
@stevecook @goatapp has to be my new favorite app 👟 🔥
@soleheatonfeet @goatapp Wait I thought it was just me. I’ve been dropping off packages everyday this week and no movement
@goatapp Its been 2 months and my seller request hasnt been submitted.. Can I speed this up somehow?
@goatapp dm u
@soleheatonfeet @goatapp I ordered a pair for 1350 and they've been sitting at today with a ups label on em since Tuesday
@soleheatonfeet @goatapp Too much volume lol
@soleheatonfeet @goatapp took me 3 days too get my money
For real tho @goatapp
@goatapp @goatapp you guys take two days to answer and I’ve made it clear the seller did not send the shoes in time. Instead of asking me what I wanted to do you went ahead and allowed another day for seller. This is absurd. What a lack of communication !!!!
@goatapp @goatapp I have been selling very actively on your website. Since I can’t call anyone. I need to know the laws that if a seller doesn’t send in time you go look for another shoe in same price or allow seller to get an extra day WITHOUT contacting the buyer. This is insane!
@goatapp @goatapp where in your by laws does it say if a seller doesn’t send the shoes in time that you go look for another comparable pair without contacting the buyer!?
@goatapp Can I get an update on my seller status?
"@goatapp It's been 3 days and says seller has confirmed order but, has yet to ship it to goat. How long does it take 😭"
"These offers, i swear. Should be banned from @goatapp https://t.co/nF63cqTWFv"
"@goatapp the app does not let me put offers up for sneakers , would that be a tech issue ?"
@dh_industries @goatapp i fucking knew some fucker would get that lucky
Please ban ur user who been having issue with their payment method... accepting offer 4+ times on the same shoes.. they just keep trolling @goatapp @goatsupport https://t.co/EbZc0zJ4DX

@PapaJawnz @ATrainKickz @goatapp Henlo m8s I am a real person not troll
@ATrainKickz @goatapp Correct. Whoever has the higher GOAT score gets preference and the sale
"@ATrainKickz @goatapp No, enlighten me"
"@geejmasterflex @goatapp My first sale with them a long while ago and I asked this question, I had to goto a UPS store out of my way to ship or get canceled... they must figure the 72 hours they give you makes up for that... 🤷🏼‍♂️"
@geejmasterflex @goatapp It is for UPS
Can someone tell @goatapp Saturday isn’t a business day
@goatapp I have sent 4 e-mails to goat app and there is no reply to me. I had purchased a pair of EQT and the tag was separated from the shoes. So I requested to return it and order another pair of EQT. However Goat just send me the one that I have returned. Goat does not response to me.

"@goatapp what's the point of ""sell now"" when it takes you hours upon hours to verify a listing and then the price drops so it doesn't sell now. Happens every time it's ridiculous. You need to verify faster or reserve the sell now feature. Smh"

"@goatapp @goatsupport please do not tell me to mail “help” because your customer service keeps recycling the same script response and ignoring my issue. I need human help, you guys are normally good what is this?"
"@goatsupport @goatapp I have emailed your support, I keep getting automated responses. My pictures aren’t being approved- keep being asked to retake - OVER and OVER I need a human response- please!"
@goatapp have 3 pending questions via the app..ever going to answer?

@KingKaiser718 @goatapp Did they respond to you about this yet?
@KingKaiser718 @goatapp Man this is ridiculous. So sorry to hear this smh
@KingKaiser718 @goatapp Wow. That’s crazy. Hopefully just a mix-up due to holiday craziness and not anything intentional or malicious.
@Mdnate @goatapp I took pics thankfully when I posted them on eBay . Bad situation man
@Mdnate @KingKaiser718 @goatapp nate is such a smart guy. i do the same when i sell anything
@je_elrick @goatapp Lot of bs going on in the holiday season man . But I have my proof hope they have theirs
@KingKaiser718 @goatapp Wow 😮
Be careful selling on @goatapp they sent me a return of my yeezys  with two different sizes . I not only bought the item from a store that double checked the shoes but I checked myself and they were the correct size. Please send me your legal departments contact info .
"@goatapp goat has upwards of $700 of mine tied up and will not respond to a single email, DM or tweet for help"

@goatapp Been trying to get in touch with your customer support for 24 hours on a time sensitive situation with 0 help or response. Owning an app myself and doing a first time purchase on goat I could not be more unhappy with the service. Maybe someone can eventually respond tome
@goatapp @goatsupport why does https://t.co/dnBVyMnhoO not let me login anymore? Also why do push notifications not work on your app?
These legit to you? @theyeezymafia @yzylab @MalakaLips @media_kraken @clickskicks @yeeSeem off. Got them from @goatapp https://t.co/cFUUrofTia
@goatapp came in clutch. https://t.co/wnNHpnDJMD
@goatapp can you please explain pending orders for 48 hours?
@TaKeOvEr215 @goatapp We don't have that problem over here.  Now if you said we want to list it super high then yes that would be accurate.
@Ltizzle420 @ThePhenomIsHere @YZYSPLY @BoostGoddess @JayChizza @theyeezymafia I don't have a @goatapp profile.  Might have to check them out
Finally at 500 on 🐐. Had some cancels so it took me a bit longer. Not that it matters since their is no benefit. Should get at least a 1% discount or instant cash out once something is sold. @goatapp @goatsupport https://t.co/0Pw6XU7VJ8
@TheSoleCloset @goatapp Must sell fast before Saturday 😂🤦🏽‍♂️
@goatapp can you please add the Kyrie 3 What The to the app asap. Have pairs in hand!

@Apple thanks for the horrible camera it won’t even focus when trying to take a pic of the shoe tag for @goatapp
"@goatapp I sold these shoes(Jordan 11’s) and they were delivered to GOAT on 11/21. They have not been authenticated and there are no pending credits for me. Also, I shipped 4 items to GOAT yesterday that have already been authenticated. What happened to my other shoes? Please DM. https://t.co/L8ogej5Avz"

@JasonsJigs @stockx @goatapp https://t.co/ZGCoVgUNb6 it’s coming
@JasonsJigs @stockx @goatapp @div3rse_ said he was going to do this
New idea - someone create a sneaker exchange that accepts and pays out in crypto @stockx @goatapp
@goatapp so I’ve been trying to cancel an order since last night and you guys won’t respond
@__JiggyJuice @goatapp Ohhhhh nahhhhhhhhh @goatapp RESPOND!!!!!
"@Edlauren11 @goatapp How I ordered brand new yeezys and they emailed me saying there was a mistake on their part &amp; the yeezys are actually used, but ya didn’t make a mistake to take my 650 though right? I WANT MY REFUND🗣"
Let me find out @goatapp already in the verification proccess when i just shipped out yesterday 💪
@idontpayresale @goatapp It took weeks for me to get verified lol
@goatapp verify me
@BrokeSaturdays @BOOSTLINKS @FortiBrendan @goatapp @stockx Yeah
@Telectrix @tbh_RGS @goatapp Ahhh yes they did give us the stats
@goatsupport @goatapp this show has literally been sold 5 times on my account. I WILL NOT CONFIRM IT. I didn't list it or sell it. This is bringing my points down! https://t.co/jjBnAs0Bij
@BOOSTLINKS @FortiBrendan @goatapp @stockx anybody need this size 6?
@goatapp can anything be done to speed up my seller verification? I really want to sell on goat and waiting this long has been frustrating!
I need you guys to answer my email ASAP @goatapp
@BOOSTLINKS @FortiBrendan 379...ouch...still better than @goatapp and @stockx got a size 6 carted if needed
I definitely emailed you guys back &amp; you guys have yet to respond @goatapp!!!
So @goatapp Can you just send me a pair? https://t.co/lMn8ocGBTD
"@XpeepeepoopooX @stockx @goatapp Same thing happened with my calabasas, came scuffed and leather apart from shoe I emailed them with pictures and asking for my money back and they also said “looks just fine from our view” haven’t bought a shoe from @stockx since."
@stockx @DannybSZN It looks fine? Dirt marks and scuffs are FINE to you? @goatapp would’ve declined these in a heart beat. The fuck is wrong with you
@goatapp What is the current cash out fee? thanks
@dallasreps @goatapp
@goatapp Can i please get a pair of calabasas (sorry for wrong spelling). I really need them
@DarynLct @goatapp 🤔
@C_Native @goatapp trade me 9.5 for the 11.5 ?
@goatapp how come the app updates so slowly? Do i need to delete it and reinstall?
"@goatapp submitted seller req weeks ago, followed w/ support ticket through app. Still no approval or email. What do I need to do?"
@Chris_Walsh27 @goatapp @flightclub #preech
"@goatapp Yeah not for retail you bitch, @flightclub did it"
@goatapp these is 🔥 thanks guys https://t.co/2y3P9xW1cg
@goatapp I haven’t sold or purchased anything but I have a pending deposit in my checking account. Does that mean I WON?!
"@goatapp Can you please varify me, I need to sell like 6 pairs of shoes."
@timcookss @goatapp @goatsupport Happened to me once and they just went through with the sale after I emailed them
@timcookss @goatapp @goatsupport It will get consigned
@goatapp verify me smh
@goatapp I need support ASAP. I emailed you guys @goatsupport
The @goatapp is legit 👌🏼 will definitely be making more purchases
"@Amorin10 @goatapp Lol , what have you been using before bro ?"
@goatapp is legit 👌🏼 will definitely be making more purchases
@ProudMoolie @goatapp The points really don't mean anything after 150.
@goatapp takes way too damn long to deliver
@Bashlol @Zhieeep @goatapp ...
@timcookss @goatapp @goatsupport O and there is a $1 consignment storage fee per month until the item sells.
"@timcookss @goatapp @goatsupport (2/2)
Option B. We can ship them back to you for $20.30, which covers shipping costs to and from us."
"@timcookss @goatapp @goatsupport (1/2)Option A.We can offer you a one time option of consigning them with us. We’ll re-list the sneakers and allow you to activate the listing. Once sells and the order has been processed, you’ll receive a cash out. The commission would be the same rate based on your seller score"
Thanks 🤞🏽 @goatapp #NOSTATIC https://t.co/aijDp2FRxf
@DempseyDulaney @goatapp Means shit if your name isn't David Katz tbh
@basebal2513 @goatapp what about when you get to 3700 then what
@DiSants11 @goatapp @goatsupport Did you have to pay to have it shipped back?
@timcookss @goatapp @goatsupport this happened to me before and they told me tough luck lol
I shipped an order on Saturday but Goat cancelled it today because the shipping didn’t update.. what happens? Any help? @goatapp @goatsupport
@Zhieeep @SupNightLive I may or may not have sold my soul to the resale beast that is @goatapp for a pair...
I posted a shoe for sale on @goatapp for the highest offer but it won’t sell what’s the deal?!
@goatapp Untill today I never got it
@goatapp I never got my email????
"@goatapp why did I get a sneaker verification email, and now my order was at shipping to Goat. Now it’s back to confirmed."
"@tbh_RGS @TheSwollLife @goatapp I did as well, I think I'm going for 500 next raffle"
@John_Wright4 @goatsupport @goatapp I guess they would rather lose money than be more efficient 🤦‍♂️
@SoleCali @goatsupport @goatapp I mentioned something about that to them before and they said it was something they’re working on. But that was over year ago so
@John_Wright4 @goatsupport @goatapp It’s crazy they haven’t done this yet. Would save them a ton on shipping and more money in their own pockets too.
@SoleCali @goatsupport @goatapp Agreed
@goatsupport @goatapp you guys need to offer sellers bulk shipping options. I packed six orders individually because of this. Step your game up! https://t.co/nb40KBfSbH
@goatapp @goatsupport is this considered damaged  box? https://t.co/ioKQxtyteG
@ace_kickz @goatapp Bro they could care less
"@goatapp so im tired of getting charged by duties by the ""other guys"" . please tell me yall can ship with USPS for Canada ?"
@goatapp if my box id is creased is this considered damaged box? ????
@FuseEleven @stockx @goatapp I make more money
@kicksinQu @stockx @goatapp is that all?
@FuseEleven @stockx @goatapp Goat has better customer service
@kicksinQu @stockx @goatapp explain why not
@FuseEleven @stockx @goatapp Nope
@stockx &gt; @goatapp
@goatapp is anyone working your customer service tickets?
@basebal2513 @goatapp Agree!
@goatapp I got a size 10 and wanting to trade for a 11 or 12
Does this need to be listed as damaged box? @goatapp @goatsupport https://t.co/A41vufEJRy
@goatapp your app doesn't update market prices for me so it shows wrong real time top offer and low price. i need this fixed immediately
@goatapp I ordered some YeezY’s and they were $470 and the purchase isn’t in my order history and I haven’t received an email
@goatsupport @goatapp it’s been a week since my shoes shipped from the seller. I placed an order for an early pair to get it early. I understand the time frame described by Goat but this is past that
@goatapp I ordered some Yeezy’s for $470 and I don’t see it on my app so can you help or Give me a call or email me @vaughnspivey.vs@gmail.com
@goatapp y’all should start accepting bitcoins as a payment.
"You’ve always impressed with your shipping…but now with those new warehouses, it’s impeccable! @goatapp 🐐 https://t.co/yrDOFoKHmN"
Hey @goatapp &amp; @stockx ...suggestion for both...add a sneakers size swap for $50 or less to your apps. I guarantee you it will drive even more business. Trust me 👌🏾
@goatapp does this count as damaged box?? https://t.co/cnG1BY3N4N
@nlpthk @HouseCarts @HeatedSneaks @theyeezymafia @goatapp thanks for a fair chance in the raffle .
@dh_industries @KTrampus @goatapp Now that's what I call a W
@goatapp hey I put up a listing and wanted to take offer. Sale never went through all day yesterday. Can u help. I'd like to mail shoes today.
@goatapp it’s been a week since my shoes shipped from the seller. I placed an order for an early pair to get it early. I understand the time frame described by Goat but this is past that
@ProudMoolie @goatapp Why I can't ship multiple pairs in the same box like. 😴
"I cancel orders constantly on GOAT, because they have zero incentive not to after 150. Every 200 points they should lower fees .5% and at 800 points they should offer BULK shipping.

Can't believe I just picked up one of my grails for the low low S/O @GOATapp for the best prices!!!
hey @goatapp where is my email i won and ain’t got no email https://t.co/8HSF7aNZIR
@goatapp please help having an acccount issue
"@goatsupport @goatapp I’m having issues with listing due to the app saying I’m not taking proper photos (I am) and the customer service rep keeps asking me for a SKU- it’s all new listings, not just one."
So yeah I didn't win the Black Friday shit from @goatapp 😒
@La3_id @goatapp I got none
@La3_id @goatapp ^^
@goatapp This has been like this for about 2 months now still nothing. I’m just trying to make us both some money?! https://t.co/wr2i4U4QUa
@La3_id @goatapp they didn’t say anything when i sent my teals in without extra laces
Out of 30 people one said yes … ok lets investigate I don’t wanna hear none of your shit @goatapp “Missing extra laces” BS
@ATrainKickz @goatapp Never did with 3 diff phones
Do ur push notifications work on @goatapp ?
@goatapp having a facility on the east coast is clutch
@TheSwollLife @Telectrix @goatapp Sorry I’m hella late but I went for $1000
@goatapp Size 13 / DMs OPEN
@goatapp my order for some shoes just got delayed how long is it going to take to fix that
@ProudMoolie @AriCagan @goatapp The cash out fee is ridiculous.
"@goatapp 
Did you announce the winners for black friday?"
@goatapp But they ain't for retail tho 😂😂😂
@goatapp @goatsupport is this box considered damaged? https://t.co/2uJg2g0sBH
@ProudMoolie @goatapp We should have a very small time frame where we are allowed to cancel orders without a hit. Like 30 mins
@goatapp Hey @goatapp wanted to follow up on this question
@HallowKicks @goatapp that's wonderful
@HallowKicks @goatapp there should be a cap of course like StockX who doesn't allow sellers to get lower than 8%
@trunxs0605 @goatapp @goatsupport Took about 6 months for me
@ProudMoolie @goatapp they NEED to add bulk shipping. better for everyone.
"I cancel orders constantly on GOAT, because they have zero incentive not to after 150. Every 200 points they should lower fees .5% and at 800 points they should offer BULK shipping.

@goatapp"
@thedonkeyslayer @goatapp Yup u do
"@trunxs0605 @goatapp @goatsupport @stockx Oh and on top of that their Black Friday contest, which they run a couple times through out the year is actually customer focused unlike stockx making you buy something to get into their contest."
"@trunxs0605 @goatapp @goatsupport It’s way better than @stockx tho trust, and they actually have customer service that responds unlike stockx"
@trunxs0605 @goatapp @goatsupport Forever bro like over a week
@trunxs0605 @goatapp @goatsupport awhile
how long does @goatapp @goatsupport seller verification take?
@C_Native @goatapp Jeez
Thank you @goatapp and @yeezymafia for my gear!!! https://t.co/Wpb132yEPI
I️ emailed @goatapp begging for my money back and not to ship the shoes 😂😂 really hope they bless me
@Damianbnb @JayChizza @stockx @goatapp Maybe/ maybe not...this was the largest Yeezy release...resell is not going to be that much especially next week when people start getting their shipments...either way I had two W for retail so I’m good https://t.co/EIBIT5RTEI
@goatapp is this box considered damaged? https://t.co/yKjXZ6R6KS
"@Damianbnb @JayChizza @stockx @goatapp Stockx is always cheaper than Goat plus you get $20 off your first order, just use a new email...you’re welcome."
@goatapp Size 5 anyone?? Dm me for proof

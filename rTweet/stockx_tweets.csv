Soo glad @StockX added streetwear before bogo hoodies this year. Saves the headache
@StockXSneakers @stockx Yes but not for a long time.
"How did orders I shipped to @goatapp on Saturday (3 days ago) get there today and orders I shipped to @stockx Monday (8 days ago), still not get there?! @UPS you guys are smokin' dicks!"
@steezyysosa @stockx Bro my shit is there waiting to be authenticated for a day and a half
"@oddlybritish @therealtblake @UPS @stockx Other than that, I've used them many times and sold my first item a few weeks back and waiting on payment. I'm sure they will only improve from their mistakes and delays experienced. Hopefully better customer support/service too."
@oddlybritish @therealtblake @UPS @stockx They sent me a USED pair of 'atmos 1s' and the manager at CS is avoiding to comment on this issue and blaming it on the #UPS shipping issue. I'd say wait until you ask them about what's happened in the past and get cover before you make a bid.
"if my product arrives to stockx tomorrow, will you be able to authenticate it that day and said the money? @stockx"
@StockXSneakers I trust them overall and they are working around the clock to process every order ASAP with @UPS but the team at @stockx is definitely slipping a few mistakes... hopefully they can admit it when it happens #onlyhuman https://t.co/BFmJJOeV1M
@StockXSneakers @stockx Best Lebron sneaker.
@Ose_cuervo @stockx @UPS It was hate mail 😂🤣😂
@robbiecook28 @stockx @UPS Lol
@Ose_cuervo @stockx @UPS I just sent them an email can’t wait to see how they respond
@StockXSneakers @stockx please do
@Ose_cuervo @stockx @UPS Fuck all that there is too much coming up not to order honestly I’m staying away from all @Ups deliveries though I will order YS but that is all
@robbiecook28 @stockx @UPS Im not ordering nothing or selling nothing till jan lmao
@robbiecook28 @stockx @UPS @UPSHelp Your money coming its just messed up situation we all in
@Ose_cuervo @stockx @UPS Oh I know nothing has moved on my Ups app in days fucking ridiculous
@Ose_cuervo @stockx @UPS @UPSHelp Oh no I realize that I didn’t realize Ups would fuck up so terribly ... once the website is up I won’t have to worry fml this is terrible
@robbiecook28 @stockx @UPS The packages coming to u thats gone be alonger wait
@robbiecook28 @stockx @UPS @UPSHelp They responded to me everytime i sent a message at this point your not getting the shoes back all u can do is wait for payment this is the worst time to sell shoes your better off selling via twitter and using PayPal where u kno ur payment will be received as soon as someone buys
@Ose_cuervo @stockx @UPS This doesn’t count the packages coming to me too this is fucking ridiculous
@Ose_cuervo @stockx @UPS I’m to a point where I don’t care!!! They chose UPS as their deliverer not me!!! Either pay me out or send them back this limbo shit is not working period !!! @UPSHelp hasnt done a ducking thing and @stockx hasn’t responded once ... I’m over it
@JasonsJigs @goatapp @stockx Facts. Stockx is paralysed
@robbiecook28 @stockx @UPS Broke down
@robbiecook28 @stockx @UPS They just sent my payout today its not them its ups and honestly friend its not there fault ups is really on some bs hell fed x is doing just fine i seen a fed x driver today who truck brough down and the rented a budget truck to keep delivering packages in ups is to blame
"@stockx @ups @UPSHelp how can an item be out for delivery on a 2nd day air and take more than 5 days to go out for delivery and end up with no delivery information at this time, rescheduling? And you want to charge people money for this service?"
@stockx please either get my shoes back to me or pay me out I’ve waited way to long and you people have done nothing .@UPS is who you decided use this is not my fault this is unacceptable I need my shoes or my payout nothing else will be acceptable !!!
@stockx Certified bricks
@HamiltonLars @stockx @SneakerAdmirals Love @stockx
@joshluber @stockx Who said anything about shortcutting fully trained autenthicators? Clearly yall have a need for more authenticators during the holiday season.  So is the bottleneck of your business model then the number of authenticators?
@OhItsTeddy @stockx I’m ready for that W
@OhItsTeddy @stockx Got my bid ready too... Just in case 😉
blame @stockx if i run yo pockets these folk tweakin
"@stockx there’s a bug on your app where all offers default to 30 days, no ability to do an offer for less or more"
@stockx I️ shipped my packages out today but it stills says I️ have to ship them out by Wednesday. Is it good or do I️ have to say I️ shipped them out
@joshluber @Austin117_ @curtisjorritsma @stockx My account has been under review for the past 5 days due to missing information in my account after winning a bid on an item that I was tryin to purchased. I haven’t been able to bid or sell anything and have not heard from you guys yet.
"@stockx i know you are experiencing an overwhelming influx of packages this holiday season, what is the current ETA on payments and authentication? https://t.co/iJDLSuA8l5"
@stockx Adding monthly payments was the greatest idea ever! You guys rock! 👟🙌🏼
@stockx What are your E.T.A.'S on Authentication and Payments?
@23Bred @_Cop_Em @Shiekh @UPSHelp @UPS @goatapp @stockx Damn that's fukd..I got my kaws 4 coming in hope they don't get damaged
@stockx @djayDoe please add!
@therealtblake @UPS @stockx They did that to 8 of my packages to @stockx.
"@stockx can you please add this backpack in black? have all other colors up but black
Supreme SS17 Backpack Teal available on StockX https://t.co/4s323Z3jX7"
@stockx waiting on my supreme bag I ordered 2 weeks ago 😒
@OhItsTeddy @stockx 🤞🏻🙏🏻
@Bpfillherup @CHINNIE1380 @stockx It always says received by Knox when they receive it
@therealtblake @hunter376398 @UPS @stockx USPS is awful
@OhItsTeddy @stockx 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I hate you @stockx now that you’re using affirm you’re making me buy every sneaker and purse I’ve ever wanted. 😫 #NoOnesGettingChristmasGifts #BlameThePlug #BMF
@Sami_DeLight @stockx 😩😂😂
"@joshluber @HypeEnvy @stockx So if I want to send some kicks in to sell. I shouldn't even bother with you guys. Y'all should be telling people to hold off on sending shoes in for a week or two, so you guys can catch up. But instead shit is pouring in and delays will probably become worst.🤷🏽‍♂️"
Check out the Jordan 11 Retro Silver Anniversary (2010) available on @StockX https://t.co/QLynpoW51q
@stockx why doesn’t this include the extended sizes? https://t.co/aIcxGpgY8T
@whats_cucci @UPS @stockx Wonder what that’s like
"@therealtblake @UPS @stockx Kinda hesistant to buy things from them , been hearing stuff has been getting stolen and they’ve been delaying on shipping. Really wanted to get the OW Presto’s Or 1’s."
"@joshluber @HypeEnvy @stockx Just curious, but how does one become a ""fully trained authenticator?"""
@craigbooker0308 @SCOOP208 @stockx Gave^^^
@craigbooker0308 @SCOOP208 @stockx Same thing mine said . I have them a few extra days and it all planned out ok .. don’t panic !!
"@SNKRAddict2323 @stockx Yea they Are strict , but I have gotten flawed shoes from them .. I could tell it was a Nike flaw , but still .."
@Jobedadon @stockx Well this is only my 3rd time selling on StockX and I thought I had heard they had a strict policy when it came to damaged shoe boxes... It's not that bad but it should have never happened. Kaws did a very poor packing job
@joshluber @stockx resent the emails.  thanks for helping me with this!
@SNKRAddict2323 @stockx Ha sucking up to get that money !!! 😂🤣.  They are gonna take it bro !! It’s kaws .. and they know all about shipping BS.
@stockx I just shipped out my Kaws 4's to you guys. I typed out a little note explaining the mild damage on the shoe box. I received the box directly from Kaws in that condition.Yet the shipping box had no damage. I hope it passes your inspection! I also added more packing paper
@penguinsfan32 Pharrell Nmd HU Lost On transit and they don’t respond to my emails 2 weeks so far waiting @stockx 👎🏼😡🤬
@nvdksh @stockx For sure. Next StockX Day coming in April
@HypeEnvy @stockx That has nothing to do with it. The two issues are UPS shipping delays (which we can't control) and number of fully trained authenticators (which we would NEVER shortcut)
"@eyung @stockx Yes. Send another and reference this tweet, just in case. Thanks"
@joshluber @stockx Thanks
@antoskaluzny @stockx Yes
@carolinajase @stockx @23penny1 Goat better then StockX tho
"@joshluber @stockx In all seriousness, it was just a great discussion + I wanted to thank u for it. I was invited for StockX day and couldn't make it out due to med issues but I just wanted to let u know that your story motivated + focused me to find a legal career in the realm of my interests, thx"
Is @stockx not a data driven company. You telling me that you couldnt forsee the influx of orders coming in or scheduled to be coming in during the holiday season?
@joshluber @stockx Thanks!   Should I send another email?   My email was sent on October 30th.  🤙🏽
@stockx https://t.co/GEIfr6ZRO1
@joshluber @stockx Really appreciate the hard work. Can’t wait for my off whites and even more can’t wait for my sales to complete. I did this so backwards. Lol
@eyung @stockx Everything is delayed this time of year but Support will def get back to you via email!  Thanks for your patience
@stockx where do I put the commercial invoices as there’s 3?
@stockx Can I try a shoe on and still sell it on your site?
"@craigbooker0308 @stockx @SCOOP208 I've heard that UPS is saying that also, but that's not accurate. We are working with UPS to reroute certain products to different facilities, as we use multiple facilities in Detroit this time of year. But we are absolutely not rejecting them."
For everyone tripping about @stockx 👇🏼 https://t.co/RCgXTRRNjM
"@penguinsfan32 @joshluber @mjbuilds @stockx Lmao , but they are working “non-stop”"
@joshluber @stockx Thank you for the update! 🙌🏽
@tswank10 @stockx Working around the clock!
@joshluber @stockx I know...law of attraction...sending my resume over and hoping it eventually becomes a reality ;)
@joshluber @stockx Understandable! Thank you for the reply!

@therealtblake @UPS @stockx Do you know why let’s say I have a shoe up for 300$ on stockX and the most recent was 340? Even I had the price up for a couple of days now
@TheGuccMan @stockx For $50 A month you can flex an entire fit
"@SupremeXellence @theyeezymafia @stockx Congrats on the wedding bro, hope your bride is happy.  What shoes will you be wearing?  #waitonkidstrustme lololol"
"@stockx I know you guys are busy, but I’m still waiting on a response.  Emailed support several times. https://t.co/qBcr921R5y"
@stockx @SCOOP208 UPS said that you all are not accepting orders if it’s a lie that’s what we are told when we call them!! Why it’s saying delivery being scheduled?? https://t.co/XollD1oblt
@therealtblake @UPS @stockx Yea better to drop off

Shouts out to @stockx @joshluber for actually verifying the Js i bought were fake and for the immediate refund and not making me jump through hoops to get my money back like @goatapp did. #trusted
"@bannedGav @stockx This time of year everything is delayed - UPS, order processing, payouts, support emails &amp; Twitter replies. But everyone is working 24/7 (literally) to make sure every order &amp; customer is taken care of. We greatly appreciate your patience."
@get_soled @stockx Eh I give em a 8. Would be better if they had a little lower fees and you could buy and sell used shoes
@get_soled @stockx Agreed. They rock 🤟
@stockx you guys are great with customer support! Will definitely continue buying through you guys!
@theyeezymafia S/0 to @stockx for helping me get my shoes for my wedding #25DaysToGo
@nvdksh @stockx We don't have any legal positions so....
@Bpfillherup @stockx RIP
@joshluber @Romy_Rome_ @mjbuilds @stockx don’t blame UPS. People have been havin their kicks sitting at stockx for 2-3 days... ridiculous
@joshluber @stockx SAD! Thanks for the answer 🤛🏾
@therealtblake @UPS @stockx I️ have Kaws coming in and I’m stressing. Tracking hasn’t been updated since the 1st...
@curtisjorritsma @stockx @joshluber My package has been there for 2 days now and still hasn't been authenticated
@Bpfillherup @stockx I think that nigga just cuff your shoes.
"@MallySole @stockx @Affirm hey man, if that's your logic I can't change how you think."
@Bpfillherup @stockx It’s normal don’t worry it’ll update.
Hey @stockx Is Knox an employee or did he walk off with my turtle doves? https://t.co/kgYI9yhyzz
@therealtblake @UPS @stockx Still waiting for my kaws 4s to be processed
I think we’re all going to need 30 days of instant payout and 50% commission reduction @stockx
@wavyempath @stockx @Affirm as i would if i just gave up 300+ on a pair a sneakers
@JasonsJigs @goatapp @stockx And @UPS lol
@wavyempath @stockx @Affirm that post was from a yr ago lol but i have no problem paying the price of the whatever sneaker upfront. i just prefer this method cause you never know what situation pops up and i usually pay whatever sneaker i affirm within 3 mths anyway. like i don’t feel as bad give up 100$
@hunter376398 @UPS @stockx there rates are garbage too Shopify keeps trying to suggest UPS when USPS is faster and cheaper
@therealtblake @UPS @stockx They really had the balls to tell me starting next week there not giving receipts out anymore cause it takes to much time...
"@therealtblake @UPS @stockx on top of that it looks like they’re bombarded with deliveries, apparently they’re rescheduling deliveries because they cant handle em all."
"@therealtblake @UPS @stockx Its the principle, UPS has been slacking hard lately"
"@moemoney1510 @UPS @stockx exactly. the Pickup location serves as a pseudo UPS for the size of my building, idk why they don't scan"
I just listed an Ask for the Supreme Reversible Shadow Plaid Vest Black on @StockX https://t.co/30PozZuYZy
@pete_forester @therealtblake @UPS @stockx Totally agree
@FatherGiz @UPS @stockx that's where I'm at right now. Its on my other things too so at least I'm not expecting them to be stolen but for fucks sake its a couple gs worth of stuff
"@therealtblake @UPS @stockx That’s strange for me, whenever I drop off shoes for @stockx at @UPS they scan it immediately and my ‘ship in x days’ on stockx goes away. Or are we talking about them not shooting them out after scanning ?"
@therealtblake @UPS @stockx ah I see...they should do the same process
@therealtblake @UPS @stockx Bro UPS didn’t scan my TNF parka for 4 days...
@therealtblake @UPS @stockx They sent out an email addressing shipping delays with ups.
@dansballance @stockx It’s these damn kids man. That’s the first problem. They don’t have any clue. They are followers and are ruining the fun with their bots and YouTube videos. Dumbass “like this” comments and overall stupidity. Makes me want to puke
@moemoney1510 @UPS @stockx yeah I'm sending like 10-12 things a day with them and have pickup in my building
@therealtblake @UPS @stockx Plus their system is so slow. I've walked out of UPS stores with the scan receipt and it still doesn't update as scanned for a full day.
@therealtblake @UPS @stockx that is why I always drop it off at any ups store...they give some kind of a receipt right after you drop off the package
"@justinbonez1 @UPS @stockx @McNasty621 @TBHxNYS_187 I don't have a choice either. I dropped off in person too, scanned it in shop, then didn't ship it til a week later. No repercussions for UPS but I'm made to look like an ass"
"@joshluber @J_Cowboys @stockx You’re good josh, I’m still gonna support stock x... drop some more stock x hoodies for us to rock.."
@dansballance @stockx I dont feel bad for them. It’s not the same as it used to be. Without the internet I wouldn’t get half the steals I do but as technology changed so did the way people get them. It’s more about hype and profit. Prices won’t matter because “Hey I can make 6 payments.” 🤦🏻‍♂️
@therealtblake @UPS @stockx UPS IS ASS
@therealtblake @UPS @stockx had this same issue and package was scanned leaving another state on the last day
@therealtblake @UPS @stockx Same
I'm fed up with @ups not scanning orders when they are picked up. @stockx I'm getting anxiety out here. Do I need to send in video tape of drivers picking them up?
"@stockx in a time where everybody whines about holiday shopping and times in general, wanted to say I appreciate you and your team for all the hard work you’re doing."
@AllenKogann @ddiegoacostaa @SneakerAccess Shit Ima just try my chances with @stockx cuz this some bull.
@_Cop_Em @Shiekh @UPSHelp See what @ups doing ☝🏽 STOP using them ASAP @goatapp @stockx
"Just got the email that my @stockx seller shipped. Now to get thru this UPS backjam, then the Authorization backlog, I don't think before I buy. Why did I do this before XMas? Lol. They'll be worth it im sure. #Kith #Ultraboost #Mids."
"Hey @stockx just got your email about delayed delivery/shipping times. That’s what you get for using @UPS, they are by far the worst."
"@Iraclestic @nikestore @Jumpman23 @adidas @Kawsone8xx8 @adidasrunning @Nike @wex1200 @adidasoriginals You noticed that? Yeah it came to me dented on both sides yet the outer box it came in was completely fine...disappointing. I just hope @StockX doesn't have an issue with it. I'm about to ship them out as we speak! It was @Kawsone8xx8 fault, not mine! I added extra packing paper"
@stockx @joshluber my shoes were supposed to deliver to you guys today and now the expected delivery says not available? What’s going on
@stockx @Nickliveforever I need to ship by tomorrow but it’s not letting print the shipping label
@stockx Slept on.
@joshluber Just wanted to let you know that I'm still inspired by our convo a year or two ago.  This law student will be applying for a job with @stockx this spring... fingers crossed that I can finally make my passions law + sneakers a reality
I bought a pair of shoes last Friday and the seller has not shipped them yet. Can I cancel the order? or do I just have wait till the seller ships them?@stockx
@TheGuccMan @stockx In a way I'd feel bad for anyone financing. The concept feels like paying rent to be seen as cool. “Cool” can now be paid off in 6 easy payments! 😕
"@stockx @NPDMattPowell over 10K pairs resold at close to twice the price, resale market collapsing though 🙄🙄 should I include other main reseller whose done similar volume?"
@stockx Please change to FedEx because @UPS is trash and can’t deliver.

anyone else having problems with Stockx not accepting packages at this time? package mailed the 27th of Nov and UPS stated Stockx not accepting packages at this time!!!!!!!! @stockx @SCOOP208 PLEASE SHARE thanks in advance
"@penguinsfan32 @stockx Yeah, I emailed them today about it and they pushed it off on UPS"
@joshluber @stockx Thanks for the reply. They actually got back to me this morning. Problem solved. Great job! #stockx #customerservicedoneright
Not gonna sell on @stockx for a good bit. Been like a week since I shipped and still hasn’t arrived at stockx... they are the ones rescheduling delivery....
@curtisjorritsma @stockx This time of year everything is delayed but Support will def get back to you via email. We greatly appreciate your patience
@missmyhonda @J_Cowboys @stockx Def odd but doesn't actually surprise me. UPS delays are crazy right now so they are prob using multiple routing
if you buying sneakers anywhere other than @stockx and @23penny1 you are doing it all wrong! easily the 2 best in the market! #salute #respect
Gonna be some broke ass mugs now. Prices about to skyrocket. @stockx said they are making money. #shoesonpaymentplans 🙄 https://t.co/HVf36KWTIn
@stockx I have some kaws Jordan 4 coming in. Can I place them for sale now or do I have to have them in hand ?
I'm a lil late to the party but @stockx  is Fire.
Made my first @stockx sale today
@stockx hey was wondering how you guys are doing on getting caught up?
"@AdamTezzy @robbiecook28 @FedEx @FedExHelp @stockx @UPS That’s what I was saying?! U should always expect holiday volume to be large, and even expect it increase even more every year since almost every household in world shops online now"
@_Cop_Em @robbiecook28 @FedEx @FedExHelp What sucks is a lot of the deliveries are for @stockx who is already behind on payouts. Im sure ppl selling kicks for holiday bread or gifts and it's just putting a hault to the whole operation. How is @UPS not prepared for the holiday season rush?
"@stockx I purchased shoes 2 weeks ago and haven’t received them, can you please dm me."
"@youngfonz @stockx @joshluber Agreed, a great marketplace for consumers.  Would make for an interesting podcast"
"@stockx Fam, you guys need to get to the next level and get two day shipping for Buyer and Seller. It would be 🔥🔥🔥🔥"

Is it possible to set a cash register type sound when you get a sale notification (iOS) from @stockx ? That great sound is the only thing eBay has over StockX
@stockx yall gonna send me my money or what
"@stockx authenticate my shoes, please and thank you."
@AnbodyElse2020 @Jays4Lyfe @DonKickzPR @QuanFlix_ @stockx @UPS That’s what happens when the fakes are getting too good and there’s not enough knowledgeable ppl to check em
@BoostOG Facts @BoostOG!! @stockx is a game changing company. I just want them to make sure they educate their customers. Most of them are young and impressionable. ONE bad decision could affect them for a long time! Maybe @joshluber can do a podcast explaining the process in detail 🤔
"Credit is awesome for @StockX because it’s going to drive up the price people are willing to pay which is going to increase StockX’s revenue from fees. This is awesome. Although, it is going to suck for people hoping for steals I think."
I always get the laziest of @stockx sellers. Always take their sweet ass time shipping the shit out.  One time i wanna get a seller ship out the next day. 🙏
@stockx How do I get in touch with somebody that can help me with purchases I made but that I have not received?
@stockx Trying to get a hold of you via email about 3 shoes I purchased. Haven't herd anything back...
I fucking hate @stockx
Fuck @stockx
@howardlindzon @truefacet @stockx Thanks.  Will check them out.
@msarnoff Lots of interesting authentication businesses —- @truefacet for jewelry (we are investors) and @stockx for things
@joshluber @J_Cowboys @stockx Now this is odd. A package I sent to stock x 5 days after my first sale is scheduled to be delivered today but the first package I sent is being delayed another day. How is that even possible for a package to pass a previously sent one to the exact same addy?
@MallySole @stockx @Affirm bro if you need a payment plan to ruin your credit on shoes that cost less than a stack you need financial guidance 😂
@BoostOG @stockx @joshluber Thanks for responding @joshluber appreciate that insight. I just dont know if a kid who is 15 understands interest that well. Is there an age restriction?
@gamingwithtrue @stockx Same here
@robbiecook28 @stockx @UPSHelp Yeah I just checked my email and they paid me out. Yesterday it said it was getting redelivered. Pretty weird
@jmeeks1981 @stockx @UPSHelp That would be very cool 😂🤣😂
@robbiecook28 @stockx @UPSHelp I had the same issue and they just randomly paid me out today.
@joshluber @youngfonz @stockx I understand the business aspect of it and I am glad to hear that you took this into account before rolling it out.
@stockx why the deliveries to your warehouse keep getting rescheduled da hellll
@martynd @igniteaccel @algolia Very cool. My friends at @StockX use it for search 😎 Congrats buddy!
"@youngfonz @BoostOG @stockx The irony is that we delayed adding Affirm for largely that reason but ultimately there were too many requests from our customers to add it for us to ignore. Also, literally every other major sneaker marketplace already has it. We were last"
@stockx when will you guys send my payout... been over a week
@pjs84651 @stockx HAHAH BRO SAME
"Roses are red
Violets are blue
Ayooo @stockx can u authenticate my fucking shoe"
@stockx @joshluber Get the youth to accumulate debt is the plan of StockX huh @dangilbert ??! Make sure you teach them that $200 pair will now call them $325 bc of the one magic word called INTEREST!!! https://t.co/ujeWvXhT0r
@stockx What is your turn around time for new product requests?
@BoostOG I said the same thing. This is honestly the true business goal for StockX all that other talk is smoke and mirrors. This idea is almost like a fake bank. Get a bunch of kids in debt! Shame on you @stockx @joshluber
@Jays4Lyfe @DonKickzPR @QuanFlix_ @stockx @UPS Have also heard numerous accounts of people receiving fakes 🤔

"OCT ‘16, I accidentaly left out the dust bags on a pair of choco 750’s I sold on @stockx I 2-Day Air’d them separately so they could include it with the shoes before they ship it to the buyer. 

Now they’re saying no extra laces and no zip ties and some random markings are okay?"

"@stockx is allowing pairs to go through that if sold on any other medium would be grounds for a chargeback.

And selling back on @stockx so you can double dip the fees isn’t a viable option. You guys need to maintain your standards or you’ll lose your core audience overnight."
@stockx I am not sure what is going on with your company rite now but it is not good that my package keeps getting rescheduled. I also see a lot of other people having the same issue. Is this you causing this or @UPSHelp
I just listed an Ask for the adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Cream White on @StockX https://t.co/jf009XDjcY
@saifshaya @stockx So someone could have paid 1400 at flight club or stadium goods......get it now?
"@saifshaya @stockx Not all shoes listed as sold are sold from their site, there are other sites and companies that people buy them off of. The ask is for their site/company......"
@vcabs68 @itsjustJallday @stockx if 2018 = thursday
You guys need to release my funds. Shoes have been delivered since Saturday @stockx 😡😡😡
@stockx why is this stuck here? https://t.co/IGbjTY8ajb
@GeeHeezy @stockx 🐐 has had it for awhile now. Imagine - Ya know I wanna move out my moms but I'm still paying off my off-white collection. Only got like a year or two left in payments.
@SoleVaderr @stockx LOL what a joke. Peeps financing shoes need to get their priorities straight.
@saevaebruta @Danimal1124 @stockx @goatapp I’m glad I’m not the only one who thinks it’s a bad idea!  We are a culture of debt and companies are just adding to the problem
@Danimal1124 @BoostOG @stockx @goatapp 😣 this industry
@stockx got financing for sneakers 👏🏾... how close are you guys to offering to sell used/worn sneakers?
@stockx I have sent multiple emails about this issue and still no respond from you guys. I haven’t been able to bid or sell anything because of it.
@saevaebruta @BoostOG @stockx Nothing new @goatapp does it too
y’all made it happened. i’m so proud. thank you 😪 @stockx @Affirm https://t.co/PHzgNTYjoF
@stockx I haven’t been able to use my account for 6 days now because you guys have it under investigation after trying to buy an item and then canceling it because of missing information when my account information was fine. I replied to the email you guys sent that day and no answer yet
@MagicNMyCity1 @DonKickzPR @stockx @UPS Smh it’s crazy! We r all screwed for holidays 🤦🏻‍♀️
@BoostOG @stockx really? you guys actually support this? i was against it when i saw it on flight club already and now you guys? financing kicks lol what the fuck. also take it easy on the fees
"@stockx my package has been on it’s way to you for over a week now, and it still says en route, should I be worried?"
"@NorthSideIsh @stockx So I've never known anyone to have to wait more than a 7-10 days for sneakers to arrive after they make initial purchase. They've always been amazing. I made a purchase almost 2 weeks ago now, &amp; the sneaker hasn't arrived for verification. I no longer want them haha"
Hey @stockx. I wanted to verify a shipping concern I had. I reached out via email but didn’t hear back yet. Figured I’d try you here. Thanks. @joshluber
@MatthewMcGnarly @stockx i was hesitant about this because of this reason
@stockx i live in detroit and shipping a box from ups that is 5 mins away from you. can i just come and drop off the package to your HQ instead?
Thanks @stockx! Now I could finally afford all the cool sneakers my friends from twitter cop. https://t.co/V2DAv07u5p
@UPS I shipped shoes I sold on @stockx on 11/24/17 tracking show it's sitting in Detroit.  I really hope they are not damaged!!  Someone Please look into this...
Honestly there something fishy about the way stockx reports it’s sales. A sz 11 black kaws sold yesterday for 1400+ but the ask has been 1100 something. Can someone explain how that happens? I feel like their numbers are wrong. @stockx
"Dang, got excited seeing a email from @stockx thinking my #Kith #Ultraboost Mids had shipped but it was just an email saying they now finance sneakers...bad idea for anyone to do. But do u. My seller is taking his time shipping my sneakers, get on it man."
@gtown19047 @samk4071 @prince_of_boost @HamiltonLars @stockx @SneakerAdmirals 💀☠️💀☠️💀☠️

@CChocobo @joshluber @stockx Customer service has been on point with responses
@stockx has the worst customer support of any company I’ve ever seen. Wow they suck
@PaulContreras_ @stockx I shipped last weds but as soon as it hits Detroit it disappeared like yours smh crazy
"At what point does a purchase get voided for taking too long to receive @stockx ... I understand there is delays because of holiday, but I've never had these issues before"
@gtown19047 @jlflores23 @prince_of_boost @HamiltonLars @stockx @SneakerAdmirals Yes really mark 😫😫😫
"@stockx please do something, please. 😓 same status since last thursday.  we choose your app still versus others even with the fees. we are frustrated with the robot replies.  just please. #ups #stockx https://t.co/jbcTAyfxpQ"

"@stockx @joshluber Your support team has been phenomenal the last 3 weeks.

I have never waited more than 15 minutes for a response, and everyone is always really helpful and understanding.

Thanks for putting up with all the questions for the holidays."
"@steezyysosa @stockx Bruh wtf, I know it’s not all them. UPS is a dumpster fire right now but damn!"
@stockx cash out my shoes please they’ve been at your warehouse for like a week
@Brut23 @itsjustJallday @stockx I knew once J said he was your boy I wasn't gonna see these shits until 2018. https://t.co/V9EOpOAEyy
@mikecochenour85 @DonKickzPR @stockx @UPS Mine says this too. They are probably bombarded with 2.0s
@PaulContreras_ @stockx Mine looks exactly the same bro smh it’s terrible
@DonKickzPR @stockx @UPS That's exactly what I was thinking from the looks of the tracking... looks like @stockx   are rescheduling the delivery
"@vcabs68 @itsjustJallday @stockx look man, I mailed it via Raven from Game of Thrones, there is no tracking on birds.  If its not there in 3 weeks, check the Citadel"
@Brut23 @itsjustJallday @stockx Ship my box and don't give me any of that ups strike bullshit @Brut23
@vcabs68 @itsjustJallday @stockx Wait til UPS goes on strike
@itsjustJallday @stockx I am sure they will penalize the sellers somehow..
@stockx help https://t.co/XbtDO7gdDP
@DonKickzPR @23Bred @stockx @UPS Everyone having the same issues i see lol
"@stockx I recently setup an acct and have ordered shoes. Unfortunately, I misspelt my email addr and thus unable to login or receive emails. How do I fix this ?"
@DonKickzPR @QuanFlix_ @stockx @UPS Made an account and Tried to buy a pair of TB Ultra Boosts about 6 months ago and my account got put “under review”...... it’s still under review today smh
@Itsuglybaby @stockx it is they will update to 100% verified within the next couple days. I've had this happen several times
@DonKickzPR @QuanFlix_ @stockx @UPS @mikefrank2020
@DonKickzPR @stockx @UPS @_Cop_Em  more
Hey @stockx Can You Clarify If You Guys Are The Ones Re-Scheduling The Delivery By @UPS To Your Facilities? Got In The Phone Yesterday With UPS CS And They’re Saying Is The Receiver Making Those Changes. 🤨
"@BoostOG @mikefrank2020 @stockx Same Chris, same day uf ups hasnt come yet or next morning."
@mikefrank2020 @stockx I ship same day... but don’t go off their system message sometimes it’s wrong.
@stockx Any reason my shoes has been there for authentication over a day?
@joshluber @J_Cowboys @stockx They really need to get they're shit together after this holiday season. Customers need discount codes after this fiasco.

Not sure if I should go with @goatapp or @stockx for these next couple purchases
@sole88nyc @stockx I’m on the phone and @ups @UPSHelp isn’t even answering. Over an hour now.
@stockx do all dead stock shoes come with their box
@arieljatib @NotoriousUSB @stockx Flow employs at least three. What do you need?
"@joshluber @UPS @stockx I already emailed support@StockX.com 5 days ago. when they reply? And @UPS said that my package is delivered, but I haven’t received any package."
@StockXSneakers @stockx Their both ugly so which ever one I️ can sell for more on @stockx is the one I️ like more !
@mjbuilds @joshluber @stockx Exactly lol they expect us to be ok with the fact that UPS has delays when UPS is their choice of carrier not ours
@NotoriousUSB They must have a couple at @stockx
@youngfonz @stockx Usually only couple of days but still I like instant pay out and no middle man
@603flips @stockx Oh right you have to send the sneakers to them before you sell. Im sure it takes weeks to get paid.
@youngfonz @stockx I’ve yet to ever sell anything on stock x or goat. Would like to continue to push that off. I’d rather sell on here for the same price. And have instant money than waiting a week plus especially with delayed shipping and authenticating right now
@603flips I said the same thing I got 2 pairs just sitting! You rock with @stockx?
@stockx can you remove this fake sale 😂 plz &amp; thx https://t.co/6jf7yVmjlI
@joshluber @Romy_Rome_ @stockx I finally I got email today that you received shoes after 9 days lol. You say that you check shoes and ship out same day yet even that didn’t happen.  Why don’t you do overnight shipping on orders that have been delayed?   Your customers are doing business with @stockx not UPS.
Hi @stockx please authenticate my shoes
@stockx have done this twice already and no answer.
@stockx They best send my money or i cant get the blue tints!!!
@toddmsterling @stockx 100% truth.
@joshluber @missmyhonda @J_Cowboys @stockx Dude i know i waited 2 weeks
"@stockx Is there still free shipping for sellers? I'm getting the ad, but when I go to sell, it says shipping fees still apply."
@stockx can you guys change it back so clicking on print label in email won't direct me to the website that won't load buying/selling pages
@joshluber @stockx Bet
@stockx I send many email. But your support never reply.. It happened more than two weeks already
@stockx thank u :$
@joshluber @stockx Thanks so much.
@stockx alright even with no replies the seller have finally shipped after 5 business days. 👌
"@stockx @Affirm 
Stock x just added the greatest update to there app since the street wear update thanks for adding Affirm"
"@Dinandvdv @stockx If you ship together it risks many issues, including not getting paid on time. Please ship separately. Thanks!"
"@anshshah7 @stockx This time of year everything is delayed - UPS, order processing, payouts, support emails &amp; Twitter replies. But everyone is working 24/7 (literally) to make sure every order &amp; customer is taken care of. We greatly appreciate your patience."
@gabe4babe @stockx What do you mean?
@ashashleyo @stockx Email support@StockX.com and they can look into it
@BridgerJ01 @stockx This is largely due to UPS delays and will likely last thru the holiday season https://t.co/KLdScjvTnB
@mikefrank2020 @stockx I ship same day or next the longest
@mikefrank2020 @stockx I ship the day of or next as long as it's not a weekend or holiday.
@stockx Stop posting this stuff and focus on paying all of your customers?
"@ray42433 @UPS @stockx This time of year everything is delayed - UPS, order processing, payouts, support emails. But everyone is working 24/7 (literally) to make sure every order &amp; customer is taken care of, so if you email support@StockX.com they will def reply. We greatly appreciate your patience."
@stockx Block my account for fraud and i was using my real information and the shoes i was trying to order went up in pricing they gone send me a stupid email saying https://t.co/UMYm5hpOr3

"Hello @joshluber, been spotting a few negative comments about @UPS &amp; @stockx’s recent delay in shipping, payment and authentication process. The @StockXSneakers team is on it, right? Things seemed much faster just a few weeks ago ..."

@PowerGoh @stockx @bigballerbrand @djayDoe @djayDoe ??
@PBKicks @stockx Probably not.  Sorry!  All of our authenticators are working on Saturday to process orders so we don't have anyone who can take in shoes at the show
@Romy_Rome_ @mjbuilds @stockx Our team is working literally non-stop to process what we can
@Romy_Rome_ @mjbuilds @stockx  https://t.co/p9VuiQwrUF
@Romy_Rome_ @mjbuilds @stockx Why?  I'm bring completely honest and transparent. We don't have the shoes. UPS hasn't delivered then to us. What else can we do?
@StockXSneakers @stockx Top 3
@thehypesniper @stockx 🤙🏼 thank you! I think they should set up some incentive based system to ship as close to sale as possible. I try to ship immediately myself.
"@UPS Customer Service has been horrible, have received no solutions. @UPS has lost package and @StockX is still not reply me"
@mikefrank2020 @stockx No. I sold 4 pairs last night and shipped them today.
@stockx item wasn’t delivered today (was scheduled for today).  Let me know what I need to do.
"Does every @stockx seller take the maximum amount of days to ship? Be honest. On my last couple purchases, it has taken forever and my Kith UBs are no exception. Also, dont buy on a Friday."

@auth_spx @bkantha1 @stockx Order got cancelled 2 weeks after item was received. I waited for payout for 2 weeks. Still have not received return tracking. Item is sealed from supreme. There since you want the full story
@sole88nyc @DBlockAllDay @stockx Yeah it’s wild. I can’t imagine what will happen between now and Christmas.
Hi @stockx I had 3 items pending for delivery on my account but suddenly I am only left with 2 items and have not shipped any out yet. May I know what happened?
@DBlockAllDay @ndrewHecht @stockx Same. I get the delivery notification on some but then I get a delivery date change after. I’ve never seen this before
@StockXSneakers @stockx 👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉
@DBlockAllDay @sole88nyc @stockx Yep. Have one of those today. UPS has already been here and delivered packages but 1 is still “out for delivery”
"@sole88nyc @ndrewHecht @stockx Even packages that’s supposed to get delivered to me be getting delayed for 2 days. Say out for delivery and then error,"
@stockx is on the most next level bullshit as possible
@ndrewHecht @DBlockAllDay @stockx That’s crazy.
@StockXSneakers @stockx 👈🏻
@StockXSneakers @stockx Top 333
@sole88nyc @DBlockAllDay @stockx Crazy. https://t.co/9u4Be14mrv
@DBlockAllDay @stockx That’s actually more concerning.
@stockx  y’all slow asf at authenticating mane
@sole88nyc @stockx Not that there not updating it’s literally prolly in a truck and won’t be in transit til several days. Happened to me last week. 20 packages
@fuckedwnorubber @infamousSTYLEZ_ @stockx They scan the barcode &amp; I get a receipt but it doesn’t show in the system.
@infamousSTYLEZ_ @sole88nyc @stockx Don’t drop off without getting scanned
@DBlockAllDay @stockx I know they’re super busy but to not update scans is a little crazy
@HamiltonLars @stockx @SneakerAdmirals 😮 wow really nice pick up Lars 😍
@sole88nyc @stockx Its ups fault mostly. I shipped mad shit last Tuesday and finally started moving today. Same with goat
@sole88nyc @stockx I’m having the same issue
@CHOPCHEESEHENNY @sole88nyc @stockx It delivered! Payout should hit tm
@sole88nyc @stockx The vast majority of my deliveries are being rescheduled.
@Old_Man_Willis @stockx Same here. Swamped with holiday traffic.
@sole88nyc @stockx Seems like UPS has been struggling since Black Friday...at least in my area.
@sole88nyc @stockx Same says delivery rescheduled
@sole88nyc @stockx I’m having the same issue.
Evening @stockx . I’m having an issue with UPS updating tracking on my items I sold.
@stockx Thanks
"@stockx is it possible to sell multiple shoes, and send them all together? 
Based: Netherlands"
So @stockx will i get what i ordered on Black Friday any time soon ?
Yo @stockx what going with your Arizona facilities taking forever to authenticate I’d rather ship to MI
@XpeepeepoopooX @stockx hey that is not very nice. im telling your mom
@sneakerpremacy @stockx stockx authentication department is something else.. They don't know shit.
"@msaidov01 @stockx took 2 weeks for them to ""authenticate"" them. Said authentication failed 
(purchased from jeff staples website so they were 100% authentic) I emailed them 100x and got my money."
@sneakerpremacy @stockx 😂
Thx @stockx u realized u messed up by saying authentication failed and gave me payout
"@stockx hey guys, just wondering why my authentication % fluctuates even though everything I’ve sold has passed muster and went through? Does canceling asks and listings affect it?"
@stockx who's is your fraud partner and how can I contact them ?

"@snkr_twitr @stockx True, it’s just not a smart thing to do in my opinion."
@rixhardthanu @stockx I doubt that affects the sellers payouts. Just allows “buyers” to pay over time.
@stockx why are your customer support so bad? no one is replying me even with 3 methods to get to you guys
@snkr_twitr @stockx Tf that mean i wont get paid in full? 😐

@stockx What’s going on with UPS? It’s usually been smooth sailing shipping stuff to you guys buy both of my sales are now awaiting rescheduled delivery.
"@yzy_l @bkantha1 @stockx Lmao u a liar, no way u still waiting"
@stockx I sent in 3 retail belugas from footaction and  now I have a 50% authentication. Like wtf? I hope this is a mistake
I just placed a Bid on the Supreme The North Face Mountain Parka Blue/White on @StockX https://t.co/Tj1XgE7xL8
@UPS and @UPSHelp are absolute trash. @stockx reconsider your business logistics!
@stockx Working now thanks
@stockx my bred yeezys look a little weird. Are you guys 100 sure they were legit checked good?
@stockx Fix your site cant log in mobile app not working either
@stockx just drove 40 minutes to a ups store to ship my items and now I cant even login to the site to get my shipping labels wtf fix your site
@stockx Your servers are down.
@stockx enough w the 1-2 business days. You guys have had pending sales for me for a week. Please advise.
@stockx What's going on with my sales? Why UPS saying they can't deliver to you?
"@stockx Andy Dufresne never said this especially the ""buying"" part. But yeah other than this snafu 👍on the ease of transaction. Very very smooth will do business in the future https://t.co/auAny92HSg"
I got a complicated mood because of @stockx https://t.co/vhNDTPEf1S
@papa_smurf34 @stockx DOOOOO IT!!!! I PAY FUCKING 30$ IN EUROPE FOR ONE FUCKING PACKAGE AND I WAS SENDING 3 SHOES LAST WEEK! 90 FUCKING DOLLARS!!!!!!
@stockx Lolz https://t.co/Qwf98wHrq3
I used to brag about @stockx with how fast they authenticated but they have seriously dropped the ball. Now officially way slower then @goatapp 😔
"@vtownkickz @stockx yep someone just told me, i had to go in there pdf label and email to myself, Web isnt working for me at all."
@XpeepeepoopooX @stockx Got that Friday in delivered Monday
@vcabs68 @stockx Mobile works fine for me
@papa_smurf34 @111sggjs @stockx What kind of workout routine are you on? I can box up 1000 pairs without any pain or fatigue
@papa_smurf34 @stockx But then the liability if you lose boxes since they aren’t labeled individually unless u throw 10-15 labels on 1 big box . If u got cash like that . Pay someone
@papa_smurf34 @111sggjs @stockx one jig put all your shipping label on 1 big box. ask UPS to scan all
? @stockx https://t.co/SDvAPZB2iI
@papa_smurf34 @stockx No
@111sggjs @stockx Yeah but boxing up 100 pairs individually is a pain compared to doing 10-15 in a box.
@auth_spx @bkantha1 @stockx Screen shot from last week “liar”
@papa_smurf34 @stockx I don’t think they do but why would u care ? U don’t pay for shipping just the boxes
@vcabs68 @Chicago242 @stockx This has happened to me a number of times...it norm just fixes itself lol which sucks
@stockx any plans to allow sellers to ship out multiple pairs in a single box?
@Chicago242 @stockx  https://t.co/2HL8Vay5r7
@vcabs68 @stockx Had the same issue before — took like 30 minutes and i was back
"@stockx is there a reason why i cant get to my seller tab, nothing loads, cant print my shipping label. Tried in Chrome, IE and Firefox now..."
"@stockx I sent you an email regarding an issue I had with shipping! Due to complacency I entered a slightly incorrect shipping address. On your site it notes that you cant change this info, and now my shipments stuck in a UPS warehouse in Potsdam,NY. What should i do/can be done?"
"Whoever has an ask of $114,290 on this pair of shoes.... cut your losses... I just put a high bid in at $28, which is $28 more than these should be worth.

"@stockx @stockx I recently just received an email that the shoes I bought didn’t pass verification, but now my account isn’t working... why is that. I have two recent purchases and I just shipped a shoe to StockX last week. Customer support doesn’t respond. ?!?!"
"@BrokeSaturdays @stockx @StockXLive I think they are having a glitch right now as I can't load product page too, let alone my selling account"
@stockx Nvm we good👌
"@stockx I recently just received an email that the shoes I bought didn’t pass verification, but now my account isn’t working... why is that. I have two recent purchases and I just shipped a shoe to StockX last week. Customer support doesn’t respond. ?!?!"
@Unr3ali2tic @stockx Yea it’s definitely just an error. I had all 7 of my shits disappear.. hopefully it’s fixed soon
@stockx my listings and sales are missing in the app and online. I just sold KAWS 4s today and now it's gone.
@TheSoleCloset @stockx Their whole server down seems like. I cant even see what I am selling and buying lol
@stockx @StockXLive how is this possible? My account wont load any listings. https://t.co/zl5Dcixp90

@stockx What’s up
@stockx Site down
@i_am_est @stockx dude i was looking at my order and i was scared af.
@stockx Actually the website erased everything as well. I can't access my items on anything
@joshluber @kevin2704n @a_e_iii @stockx I think is time you guys switch to Fedex.......UPS service is awful and at the end of the day makes the company looks bad
"@Sac_Kings_916 @stockx same here, feeling sucks"
@stockx 404 errors everywhere
@stockx @stockx I just looked on my buying page and the beluga 2.0’s I ordered disappeared
@Chicago242 @stockx It was glitchy a few days ago for me
@EduardoLorenzi @stockx 2 business days
"@WillTheThrill03 @stockx Same here, is ridiculous the amount of time it takes for a shipping to getg to you, switch to Fedex"
is the @stockx app giving anyway else issues under your personal info?
"@stockx is the app having issues? All my buy, sell, and following just got reset. I can't view any of my items"
@stockx whats up with your website and app? None of my listings are showings nor are the pendings orders to ship (even though the notice at the top says ship by XY day???)
@stockx Site is broken
"@stockx my sales history isn't appearing at all, I need to see it today to ship a shoe and check a shoe on its way to you. Please help!"
@stockx please fix your app and site. Can't print any of our labels today 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
"@stockx on second thought, looking like entire backend is down as product pages not loading either :("
@stockx keep getting error messages when I click on something. Que pasa?
@stockx wtf is up whit the site?? *404: AAAAAAAHHHH. THIS PAGE DOESN'T EXIST!* fix it plz
@stockx hey I need some help. All the items I had been following suddenly dissappeared.
"@stockx app and site not currently showing me any pending sales or info, is backend down?"
@FutureTomorrow_ @stockx Ahhh I see. I can only imagine the amount of volume from the past two weeks with all the drops.
@stockx I fw you guys ! Fuck @flightclub they can’t even send a receipt in the box ! Stockx💚💚💚
"@stockx I ordered a pair of beluga 2.0 on friday, but it says today waiting for seller to ship, how many days you give for an item to be shipped to you?"
"@stockx Hello, trying to send my shoes to you, but just when I was going to, it says the sale has been cancelled. Get in touch please"
@GodsLastSon_ @stockx I️ got five packages that’s just be chilling in a warehouse for a couple of days. I️ hope they ain’t lost.
@GodsLastSon_ @stockx ahhhh fuck. I️ hope this ain’t what’s going on.
"@DubbleA_ @stockx My other just arrived, you’re good"
@stockx why you taking so long to pay me ? My shoe came in Friday
@stockx Hey can y’all get your shipping sorted out so I can get paid. I shipped last Monday and the shoes still haven’t been delivered to you for authentication
"I shipped my yeezys and human races together, but one got authenticated and one is still in transit? @stockx https://t.co/l1EvxVw3al"
@stockx @stockx  I shipped 3 pairs to be verified but it’s stuck in Michigan for so long... damn it @UPSHelp @UPS get your sh*t together!
@stockx will u reject my waverunners since my box is like this I sold them already on stockx https://t.co/CwDDCszbe5
@edzart @stockx How is this not a thing yet? smh
@XUthefish @stockx If what they told me in several emails this morning is accurate then most likely they're already but they're pretty backed up.
@stockx sells my stuff fast 🤓
"@joshluber hey mate, why can’t italians sell on @stockx anymore? Pretty unfair tbh"
@stockx really gotta start accepting from Fedex and USPS @joshluber now
@stockx 🤞🏼Let’s go payout .......
Probably a good sign for @stockx they being overloaded with sales to the point they not even accepting deliveries lol
@kickzjilla @stockx Their twitter said expect delays
"@stockx They already reduced fees for all day Saturday a week ago. This isn't on stockx, it's UPS and is as expected this time of year. Keep up the good work stockx."
hi @stockx please enable a 2-factor auth login
@stockx https://t.co/W2NzwLYiT7
"@stockx my account has been “under review” for weeks even after submitting all the requested documents, and have yet to receive an update!"
@stockx What time does you Customer Service usually respond to inquiries?
@stockx Going on 2 weeks already and shows u guys still didn't get sneakers to authenticate yet. Some incentive for inconvience??
@stockx I haven’t received mine it’s been 1 week. And I sent an email 3 days ago.
@stockx @maxbmoc @joshluber I know this is an old post but... Unless stockx declares a value on the package you send before you ship it out (which they didn't for mine) then fedex will only pay up to $100 for your lost package
@stockx I sent out my sneakers since the 11/29.. nothing yet🙄🙄😳😳
@DBlockAllDay @kickzjilla @stockx Shipping has been slow with UPS all of a sudden
"If I cop the fender Stratocaster Supreme collab, will you guys allow us to sell that on your platform? @stockx"
@_Cop_Em @UPS @stockx @goatapp Because they are stupid. its not a good answer but it's also not a wrong answer.
@The_MPire_ @UPS @stockx @goatapp CORRECT SMFH thing that I’m most pissed about that has made me even angerier is that my packages were already here in my city for 5 days sitting less than 30 min away &amp; wouldn’t let me pick up. WHY WOULD THEY REROUTE TO DALLAS WHICH IS 4 HOURS AWAY INSTEAD OF DELIVERING LOCAL?
"@_Cop_Em @UPS @stockx @goatapp Yup and their entire ""customer service"" department coukd be replaced by a looped recording of someone saying ""I'm sorry, I have literally less information than you about your package, bye"""
@The_MPire_ @UPS @stockx @goatapp THATS MY POINT EXACTLY! Dec for me as a business is my busiest month. I use USPS for outgoing ONLY w/very few short delays but a lot of my own vendors for our supplies &amp; inventory only offer UPS so if I can’t get things in I NEED I can’t get ANYTHING out to my own customers!
@_Cop_Em @UPS @stockx and @goatapp need USPS options. I've shipped like 3/4 days before Christmas and had no delays there. I shipped this shit in November and they're already delayed? How are they possibly going to handle the rest of the month?!
@kickzjilla @stockx Same. I shipped some shoes last Tuesday and just started moving today smh. Gonna get there Wednesday
Ya’ll awake? @stockx im tryna get my money for a shoe that had been delivered to you last week
@FutureTomorrow_ @stockx Same here been waiting since Nov 23 with no new update. Hasn't even made it to Stockx yet...
Any Idea When Account Features Will Be Back Avail.  Has Been Like This for 30Mins or So.  All Other Tabs Working.... @stockx https://t.co/dQ9XZ5y72R
@TheUPSStore @UPS none my packages have reached @stockx what’s going on?
@R3Z1N @joshluber @stockx Only if their growth has no overhead cost increase. And since it's a physical goods trade and verficiation website a plateu of efficiency is expected.
@stockx You guys could legitimize secondary sunglasses . I'm looking for Oakley racing jackets Asians fit lmao. Add sunglasses!
@stockx can I get a discount code I made a new account please
@stockx my item is being authenticated since Friday now is it normal ?
@VpShoefanatic74 @stockx I would suggest USPS!!
"@joshluber @mjbuilds @stockx Agreed, but you guys have the power to due something for the delay that UPS is causing.  Act on it, or risk on losing loyal buyers &amp; sellers. Reputation actually matters. C’mon now."
@IjnanyaBunn @stockx Lol
@stockx I’m scared to send shoes now 😂
"@joshluber @stockx Regardless, your fees are high. Given the explosive growth, one would think that you’d be able to reduce your fees being that your customer base is much larger."
@stockx @joshluber I will but I'm on your chat and nothing. Why is Mish away for over 5 minutes and why did I get a canned response that didn't even ask for my specifics of address the problem? Why offer chat if you don't have the resources to properly manage it?
"It’s funny how .@goatapp keeps sending me emails wanting me to continue to purchase from them, but have ignored my concerns &amp; refuse to admit on sending me damaged Yeezy’s! 

.@bbb_us should look into this matter

I think I should try .@stockx, they more reliable &amp; trustworthy?"
@UPS and @stockx  what’s up I️ shipped from Columbus on Thursday no way my shit should still be in transit!
@joshluber @stockx @stockx has a pinned statement on their feed regarding delays in payments and shipping. I'm concerned because this will be the 4th shoe I'm sending to StockX and if you're having UPS issues when are these 4 pairs going to arrive and when will I be paid out? That's my concern.
@stockx I sent in an item I sold about 4 days ago and It says it is still in route for verification and there is no tracking information?
"@mrjglee @stockx @joshluber @J_Cowboys It's been 7 days since the item shipped to StockX. It says ""Expected Delivery:...Not available"". Keep in mind the shoes have not even shipped to me yet. So we're looking at 2.5, possibly 3 weeks to receive a pair of shoes."
@FutureTomorrow_ @stockx What payout concerns? We are still processing every order as soon as possible. If UPS hasn't delivered there is nothing we can do.
Anyone not using @stockx to sell shoes/clothes/watches is insane. Great platform and A+ customer service. Wrote them an email and got a reply 10 min later. That’s why I’ve turned multiple people like @Mike9814 and @kellllld onto it 💪🏼
@FutureTomorrow_ @stockx @joshluber @J_Cowboys Normally within 1-2 days you should get an estimated arrival date from ups.
"@FutureTomorrow_ @stockx @joshluber @J_Cowboys Buying is a bit different, sellers can sell from multiple countries which delays the process further. I sell from the USA &amp; Germany"
Can't recommend selling or buying on @stockX - Now that they're having issues I noticed some other troubling features of the site I should have caught before. I've just deleted all my asks and will write a full review of StockX as a service shortly.
I just listed an Ask for the adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Beluga 2.0 on @StockX https://t.co/r2ND1DT3L3
@stockx Is it possible to cancel a current sale due to this problems? I don't think it's wise for me to send @stockx a 4th shoe under these conditions because who knows when I'll get paid out? I haven't yet on a single pair.
@stockx @joshluber is it possible to cancel a sale due to concerns regarding StockX payouts? I was about to send StockX my 4th shoe this morning but I haven't even been paid for the 1st. Now we're seeing the truly ugly side of this service.
"@stockx @mrjglee @joshluber @J_Cowboys I'm now going on my second shoe about to be with StockX, the first doesn't even state when it will arrive at StockX, much less get shipped to me."
"@joshluber @J_Cowboys @stockx Really? Ordered a pair of shoes over 7 days ago and it still hasn't arrived at StockX yet. We need to start discussing the option to cancel an order and order from a more reliable source. Don't care for excuses, I want the overpriced shoes I paid for."
@stockx What is going on with my orders and the lack of an order number? I can't even contact someone and make a unique reference.
@ADYMofficial @stockx @adidas @OhItsTeddy @wex1200 @BoostGoddess Have a 10.5 DS if anyone’s interested. DMs are open
"@stockx @joshluber @J_Cowboys It's already settled, accepted nov 21, verified/ paid out nov 29th. Already had CC investigate the issue. Just letting you know issues with the process definitely happened before the beluga 2.0"
@stockx My advice to you is turn your business over to FedEx. I switched for my business years ago and never looked@back. They take better care of the packages and there are no delays for the holidays. Better company all the way around.
"@stockx No problem. We understand the influx of business with 80,000 YEEZYS headed your way. 💪💪💪💪"
"@stockx Yo stockx, I've sold 3 pairs and need to print 3x3 invoices because I'm about to ship internationally outside of the EU. It says I should put the 2 inside, but can I leave it with 1 printed onto and 2 extra with it when they pick it up? Or do they need to be inside?"
@stockx how can I cancel my order with you guys? I purchased a pair of off white 1’s. The service is slow. I would rather buy from @goatapp
@stockx hi - can you DM me? i get this error msg ea time i go to the site. Chrome doesn't work nor can i access from the app. please help https://t.co/po8f3LCuGI
"@stockx We understand that the delays are caused by UPS. But at the same time, we are YOUR customers. Discounts codes on seller fees or free shipping is a small price to pay for the our business."

@joshluber @J_Cowboys @stockx Not in my case. Over 7 days at StockX with no update
@DavidLegits @stockx Most of the delays are caused by UPS.  If we don't have the shoes we can't process them. This looks like a UPS issue
@CopSoles @stockx Most of the delays are caused by UPS.  If we don't have the shoes we can't process them.
@mjbuilds @stockx Why?  UPS is delayed across the country. Most of our delays are caused by UPS.  If we don't have the shoes we can't process them.
"@KeithLam111 @stockx Fees are lower than all other major marketplace, plus they go down the more you sell, which some don't"

@joshluber @stockx ?????? Tracking said it was going to be delivered tomorrow but now it says unavailable. UPS is going to ruin my credit. Can you please do something about this? I’ve never let you guys down....

"@stockx Still waiting for my payout, shoes arrived on thursday."
@joshluber Will @stockx be doing fee-free selling again in a booth/tables at #MSXC on December 9th? 🙏🙏
@StockXLive @stockx Straight from 🇨🇳
@stockx Would be cool if you fixed the totals on our portfolio page! Thanks
@StockXLive @stockx My size 😩
"@stockx Also, if a pair is DS but was tried on possibly once, would that be eligible to sell? It wasn't worn outside or anything but want to be sure! Just to switch out for a different size down the line."
"@stockx You said you sent my money on Friday to my bank account, why do I not see it yet?"
@stockx there anyway I can send you guys stuff last four digits of my cc and my ID to verify that I'm the one making the transaction because I'm being reported as fraud from your fraud  prevention partner and it's not it's actually me making the transaction.
@stockx @mvsonlee I have it doesn’t change anything
@stockx @MadMatt7783 thank u very much

@stockx How about no fees for selling the 10
@NYCsneaks23 @stockx Fraudulent payment maybe?
@stockx thanks guys https://t.co/MF0xbfNQU2
@XpeepeepoopooX @Yung_Scut @Zilinski21 @stockx @DannybSZN That’s the only stuff I won’t touch 🤢
@PapaJawnz @Yung_Scut @Zilinski21 @stockx Even stuff from @DannybSZN
"I had a sale with @stockx that I shipped accordingly The shoe sold last week. When I shipped the shoe, it did not say cancelled. I never received any notification/email saying the sale is now cancelled. What could have happened?"
@XpeepeepoopooX @Yung_Scut @Zilinski21 @stockx Stuff that’s not DS too
@Yung_Scut @Zilinski21 @stockx They authenticate anything real or fake
@stockx please put kith x moncler apparel on the site.
@Yung_Scut @stockx Ty
@stockx can I sell supreme without price tag through your app if it’s brand new?
@stockx been trying to contact support for almost a week. Sent two emails with no reply to either. What's going on here?
@mvsonlee I’d rather have to many than none at all. I never know when A bids placed on stuff I’m selling. It’s cost me sales @stockx
@joshluber @thesIvmpgod @stockx Ok thanks a lot l emailed that address a few hours ago and didn’t get a reply but thanks for the reply Josh

@stockx https://t.co/QkcNWX10aA
@StockXLive @stockx 👌😍
@stockx we need 2factor auth... we are dealing with money here...
@stockx how long until I get my shoes it still says waiting for seller to ship and I have been waiting almost a week now
@stockx how long until I get my shoes
"Hey @stockx a little worried about my most recent order, it still hasn’t made it to you from the seller after more than a week. In the past I wold have received my shoes by now, they usually come really fast &lt;3"
@stockx its time to expand to NYC or give me a position to run NYC
"@ibeenhaddat @stockx If its been 3-4 days &amp; it's the wknd, that might just be a delay - sorry, its busy!  Second, they may not have an update;  your info may have been submitted to our fraud prevention company to see if they can clear you &amp; since its Sunday there's  no answer yet"
"@joshluber @stockx it's not a delayed response, I am being ignored. My account has been locked even (cont) https://t.co/THYg7DbxpK"
Does @stockx authenticate on Sundays?
@stockx if you were to buy from stockx from the UK and pay $40 shipping does this include import tax or will I have to end up paying nearly 60-70 for shipping?
@stockx Or plz DM me
@stockx Can someone contact me ASAP
@joshluber @stockx Advanced payouts?advanced payouts?
@nateskicks4 @stockx Happened to me also. Took about 4 days
@stockx sent out 2 shoes on the same day at the same time. One already got authenticated and I got paid for it. The other pair still says “en route” any idea how much longer it’d take and why one got delayed so badly?
@joshluber @stockx @goatapp I appreciate your reply but doesn’t the seller have to ship out within a certain amount of days. Seems like the seller of my shoes didn’t ship out right away. Which delays the shoes getting to me. Just want my shoes. #frustrated
@Ivan24459478 @stockx There's nothing we can do if UPS hasn't delivered the shoes to us. Sorry!
"@jkudashoe @stockx @goatapp This time of year everything is delayed - UPS, order processing, payouts, support emails &amp; Twitter replies. This sounds like a UPS issue. But everyone is working 24/7 (literally) to make sure every order &amp; customer is taken care of. We greatly appreciate your patience."
Anyone else having issues with slow delivery times for @stockx Placed two orders 1.5 weeks ago and shoes still haven’t made it to @stockx Maybe I should stick with @goatapp This wait time is unacceptable. Let’s see if I get before 3-4 weeks from order date @joshluber
@joshluber @stockx ??

"Ordered two pairs of shoes from @stockx . Yesterday the tracking showed they had been delivered and left at my front door. However, I didn’t find anything anywhere. I don’t know why @stockx only uses @UPS ground shipping which is unsafe.@UPSHelp can u help me find my packages?"
@goatapp can you guys hook me up with the Yeezys 2.0 Beluga for $340. I rather spend my money with you guys then @stockx
"@MIC1906 @Chase83682376 @DavidLegits @stockx anything on release tbh mate, got beluga 2.0 yeezys last week off the Size? app"
@CChocobo @stockx Not by a person; maybe by a system email? Or maybe you are already past 2 days?
"@DesyreeNicole @stockx Anything that is/was in transit is current impacted. There is literally nothing we can do if it's en route from UPS.  Yes, we are considering express options; we are considering everything."
@nateskicks4 @stockx You’re private they won’t see this my guy
@joshluber @stockx Then why am I being asked to ship today? :(
@CChocobo @stockx Sunday is not a business day
@Addxh @Chase83682376 @DavidLegits @stockx What kind can you get in the uk
@Addxh @Chase83682376 @DavidLegits @stockx What can you get for retail in uk
"@MIC1906 @Chase83682376 @DavidLegits @stockx these 😁 supreme air force 2s, now i just try and cop retail https://t.co/ajHVm4dVc0"
"@stockx @joshluber UPS stores are closed on Sunday’s, so dropping packages off really is a hassle / not even possible for some people.

Just something to be aware of now that Sunday is considered a business day for sellers to ship."
@jaipark23 @ChrisLy1nch @stockx 11
@ChrisLy1nch @stockx Size?
@stockx When did this happen?
"@stockx I would love to buy me a pair as I was  trying to do but, i'm a first time buyer and you guys cancel my order and my account because you guys thought It was fraud but it isn't."
"@stockx I'll like to report a incident I had while trying to buy shoe but, no one via email will text back."
@Addxh @Chase83682376 @DavidLegits @stockx What kind of shoes? And where do you cop now?
@MIC1906 @Chase83682376 @DavidLegits @stockx oh god i cant remember now
"@stockx with the difficulties you’re having , I️ have 8 shoes that are supposed to be paid out this week , will that be delayed as well ??"
@MidwestSole @stockx Just sent a few that way and didn’t have any issues but I’ve heard from others that delays have been happening a lot. 😕
@stockx Was about to say
@Addxh @Chase83682376 @DavidLegits @stockx What kind of shipping service did you get
@joshluber @ugottapaytoplay @stockx After being told they were in transit and would be arriving soon y’all cancelled the order and refunded rather than getting a reply to my last inquiry on the status. Hopefully this second order i placed makes it.
"@MIC1906 @Chase83682376 @DavidLegits @stockx Theyre decent, I dont think they count sat and sun as it took 2 weeks to reach me but im from the UK and had to pay extra customs tax"
@joshluber @stockx Alright Josh. Patience only is for so long. I was referring to purchases made out of holiday season as well. Have we thought about implementing an express option in which the seller &amp; stockx has to overnight if the consumer covers the expedited shipping costs?
@Addxh @Chase83682376 @DavidLegits @stockx Are they good? Do they count Sat. &amp; Sun as business days?
@MIC1906 @Chase83682376 @DavidLegits @stockx once
"I'm staring at the Off-White ""The Ten"" collection on @stockx trying to figure out if I should buy myself a Christmas gift.  Those Air Max 90s or 97s look fire. 🔥 #SneakerProblems"
I guess @nike @jordanbrand @champssports @footlocker @footaction like getting fucked wit no vaseline by youtubers who get their free shoes and sell them on bigcartel and @stockx and make money from the vidz fyi i never bought a shoe bcuz of a youtuber #facts#badbusiness#dobetter
@Addxh @Chase83682376 @DavidLegits @stockx Have you bought from StockX?
is there a reason @stockx i can’t find SUPREME x LV Hoodie &amp; T-Shirt on the Marketplace ? 🤔
@Chase83682376 @DavidLegits @stockx because people paid 220 for them
@stockx is your international shipping still 20$?
@MikeFromSLC @stockx Please email support@stockx.com with any questions about an order
@camiloromero101 @_D3adpool @stockx Yes it has delayed shipments but it doesn't change seller obligation to drop off at UPS within 2 business days. But sellers aren't penalized bc UPS delayed in bringing it to StockX.  Thanks for asking
"@ibeenhaddat @stockx This time of year everything is delayed - UPS, UPS tracking, StockX-UPS alignment, order processing, payouts, support emails &amp; Twitter replies. But everyone is working 24/7 (literally) to make sure every order &amp; customer is taken care of. We greatly appreciate your patience."
@IRONLUNG_T @SneakerGeex @stockx Not true. Selling has never been easier or safer than on StockX.
@ochocincoK @stockx No
@J_Cowboys @stockx @UPS Wish we could!  Sorry!

@stockx i have a pair of shoes that were supposedly sent to you for authentication and were supposed to be shipped out by last wednesday and no progress has been made on my order
"@bannedGav @stockx This time of year everything is delayed - UPS, order processing, payouts, support email, etc. This sounds like a delay in UPS tracking. But everyone is working 24/7 (literally) to make sure every order &amp; customer is taken care of. We greatly appreciate your patience."

"@adonisjb22 @stockx @goatapp During busy season, yes"
"@stockx my order took 1 week to be ""en route"", asked customer service, no one responded to me, my order is then cancelled on the 9th day. 👎🏽"
"@retrobrons @ugottapaytoplay @stockx Sounds like a UPS issue. Why would you be mad at StockX? What else can they say besides 'the shoe is in transit' if the shoe is still in transit?  12 days sucks for sure, but this time of year is not unexpected. And I promise once they come in we will get them out ASAP!!"
"@joshluber @retrojSstrong @stockx If there were pebbles on the sole that means it was tried on outside, not in the house."
@joshluber @retrojSstrong @stockx Then that’s not considered Deadstock.  You guys said it should be deadstock.
"@_AM_78_ @retrojSstrong @stockx If you don't have a status update that's likely a UPS issue. A pebble could just be tried on, which is allowed. if Support thought it was used they'd take it back in a second"

"@ShmadsYoDad @stockx Ship each shoe in a separate box. If you don't, you risk not getting paid on time. Too many things can go wrong. Shipping is free for sellers anyway so why risk it?"
@stockx Can I get 30% off for the inconvenience?
"I just placed a Bid on the Air Max 97 Cristiano Ronaldo Metallic Gold on @StockX 

出してみた"
@ShmadsYoDad @stockx Yeah just make sure at ups they scan every paper and theirs a paper with the shoe in the box I do it all the time
@stockx UPS is fucking up a lot of orders us make sure y’all track ur packages do you already lost two of my packages and to delays to StockX
@Ajretroking @stockx Damn lmao

@ADYMofficial @stockx @adidas @OhItsTeddy @wex1200 @BoostGoddess 👐🙌🔥
@joshluber @stockx Bruce was very helpful. Please give homie a raise
"@joshluber @VERBAL_AMBUSH Great episode! Would be interesting if @Stockx forecast future  $value of New Pharrell Hu 👟using data from 1st series. Buy, Sell, Hold ?💡 https://t.co/EYHreW3EHB"
@joshluber @stockx Thanks. I know that policy is to either find a shoe or issue a refund and I would much rather have the shoe. I wanted to check and see if finding another shoe at no extra price is common in these situations
@bkeithley83 @stockx Yes
@joshluber @stockx I’ll buy two if I get a discount 😂
"@__M__Ivan83 @stockx There's nothing we can do.  You are not alone - many pairs are delayed by UPS with little or no ifo. But as soon as UPS delivers them, we will get them out to you ASAP"
@AdamTTU1981 @stockx Email support@Stockx.com
@junglekid925 @stockx I don't think there are B Grades of Kaws but you can email support@Stockx.com and they will double check your pair.
@YellowedSoles @stockx Sorry! Shipping rates are fixed
@joshluber @UPS @stockx Thanks for the response.  Cant make everyone happy.  Lol. Happy holidays.
"@rcpro78 @UPS @stockx That prob won't happen anytime soon. Sorry!  But shipping is free for sellers, so at least there's that. Also, we know people who use FedEx and they complain about all the same things. It's just that time of year"

@stockx 🙏🏾✅
If my shoes don't come in Tuesday! I will be very upset as this is taking close to 10 days to receive. Can't even flex on vacation because of this strenuous process @stockx
@stockx please let me ship via @USPS or @FedEx
@stockx 🔥🔥 #stockx a must if you a real shoe head!! https://t.co/L9ePyANSVz
"@JackieHollywood 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 wow, didn’t even bother to suggest looking on the @goatapp or @stockx the first time around! Glad you were able to find a pair 🤗"

@ArjayTV @MartinMinnaar @adidasoriginals @wex1200 @KithSet @stockx Me too
"@samk4071 @MartinMinnaar @adidasoriginals @wex1200 @KithSet @stockx Yea same, definitely need to sell some stuff off!"
@ArjayTV @MartinMinnaar @adidasoriginals @wex1200 @KithSet @stockx I’ll end up with about 20 pairs end of the year in just November n December 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
"@samk4071 @MartinMinnaar @adidasoriginals @wex1200 @KithSet @stockx Lol true and my bad, apparently I can’t type tonight!"
@ArjayTV @MartinMinnaar @adidasoriginals @wex1200 @KithSet @stockx Better then 0% 🤔🤔🤔 after that I’m done for awhile
"Hey @stockx , i love my supreme beanies, but 13.95 shipping.  C’mon man"
"@samk4071 @MartinMinnaar @adidasoriginals @wex1200 @KithSet @stockx Good call, but odd of landing then is slim to none."
@MartinMinnaar @ArjayTV @adidasoriginals @wex1200 @KithSet @stockx Don’t forget the 4D future 🤔🤔🤔
@stockx Is it a pretty safe bet that if a seller who accepted my bid flakes out on shipping the shoes that you guys will find a pair at not extra cost? It’s beluga 2.0s and it seems like that’s what’s happening and I really want the shoes
@kzmustang @stockx no. $15 shipping fee.
@stockx you guys are the f***ing best. You are the only place I cop all my kicks from especially when I miss at retail. You guys gotta bring back the 25%off commission thing again so I can cop lots of kicks And sell. #bestplacetoshop #stockx
@Ivan24459478 @joshluber @stockx lol that's what you get for reselling
"@stockx Hi, I believe you guys had sold me a pair of B Grades. If you can get back to me, that'd be great!"
@stockx i was looking to buy a pair of sneakers. I created an account back in June but the discount code provided expired. Any suggestions?
@kangchoi @stockx Did they charge you a 15% penalty fee?
"@stockx I shipped my shoes to you guy and it’s taking for ever for UPS to drop off the shoes at your HQ , now my estimated delivery date changed from 11/29 to “unable to determine delivery date” please help out @stockx"

@stockx Still have horrible customer service
@stockx do y’all do payouts on Saturday’s like @goatapp ?
@tharealPuffPuff @retrobrons @stockx No. I think that was an isolated incident but this time of year everything is delayed so O wouldn't worry about package shipped on Tuesday yet
@joshluber @stockx @bigballerbrand @djayDoe Thanks!
"@lysk87 @stockx We will help you file a claim with UPS if you need to, but this time of year everything is delayed, including UPS and UPS scans. I'd wait for an update from UPS"
@cincinnatisole Send to @stockx they don't give a shit
@TANIK0MA @stockx Or if you like random numbers. Enjoy!!
@PowerGoh @stockx @bigballerbrand That's a good question. We'll figure it out and get back to you cc @djayDoe
@c_stephens5150 @stockx I have 3 orders 2 have been enroute to @stockx for a week now
@stockx hey guys. My customer support messenger is down and I'm not able to ask for assistance.

@stockx @joshluber Please help!!! I need answers!!! https://t.co/uOX3Fmw8CZ
@tharealPuffPuff @retrobrons @stockx From the customer
@joshluber @retrobrons @stockx Better question what are they gonna do for the people waiting on oders?
@ADYMofficial @BoostGoddess @stockx @adidas @OhItsTeddy @wex1200 That’s solid but I’m a 12 so lowest is 282. Fml https://t.co/sIVPT2B8XX
@joshluber @retrobrons @stockx What the actual fuck? Where'd you hear about this?
@STEPH_GROUT72 @stockx But I'm saying that nicely....lmfao
@tharealPuffPuff @retrobrons @stockx Earlier this week
@joshluber @retrobrons @stockx Holy shit?? How recent is this??
@STEPH_GROUT72 @stockx These fuckers always have excuses but don't wanna hear shit to charge more from your sale
"@tharealPuffPuff @retrobrons @stockx There are many shipping issues out of our control.  One @Stockx seller dropped off 3 Yeeyzs at UPS, they never showed up as scanned in on his StockX account. Turns out the entire UPS truck went missing."
@gooch305 @stockx Lmfaooo exactly! They’ll hit you with that penalty real quick
@STEPH_GROUT72 @stockx 😂but don't be late shipping them shoes tho...smh
@enginerdmd @BoostGoddess @stockx @adidas @OhItsTeddy @wex1200 @stockx Bruhhh check it out https://t.co/fx3MvV8jXs
@stockx How about waiting over a week??!!
@raypolancojr @nicekicks Also u can get em om @stockx for around $100
@djpaceone @stockx @joshluber I'm dealing with the same thing
@ADYMofficial @BoostGoddess @stockx @adidas @OhItsTeddy @wex1200 I hesitated on those inikis pride of the 70s that restocked this morning. But pulled the trigger anyways. Where are they below retail though?
@joshluber @stockx My credit card is going to go past due.. is there nothing you guys can do? I have 100% verification and 100% shipped on time level 3 seller almost 4
@ADYMofficial @stockx @adidas @OhItsTeddy @wex1200 @BoostGoddess For real! I need to grab those Oreos too
"@enginerdmd @BoostGoddess @stockx @adidas @OhItsTeddy @wex1200 You can get these for under retail right now,  I think we all hurting right now lol"
@rawrrawrbang @stockx @adidas @OhItsTeddy @wex1200 @BoostGoddess Those are a must for me! Love the patchwork them for sure gonna have to wait a minute to get those after this month
@Solesurv1vor @stockx @adidas @Footaction I got these for under retail with shipping from StockX had a coupon there too 🔥🚨
@ADYMofficial @BoostGoddess @stockx @adidas @OhItsTeddy @wex1200 Thanks man. May have to cop some from StockX. But it’s been a rough November for shoe spending
"@ADYMofficial @stockx @adidas @OhItsTeddy @wex1200 @BoostGoddess sexy as fuck bro, just grabbed the KithxNonative mids these are so clean with that black boost"
@enginerdmd @BoostGoddess @stockx @adidas @OhItsTeddy @wex1200 TTS for sure!
@HypeEnvy @stockx More than what they are going for now. Turn and burn. Too big to hold
@ADYMofficial @BoostGoddess @stockx @adidas @OhItsTeddy @wex1200 They run true to size or did you size up like unchanged?
@ADYMofficial @BoostGoddess @stockx @adidas @OhItsTeddy @wex1200 Was so shocked to see these sitting at my local @Footaction copped for retail and was able to use my $20 coupon 🙏

@ADYMofficial @stockx @adidas @OhItsTeddy @wex1200 @BoostGoddess which pair is this?
@djpaceone @joshluber @stockx I got the same thing on my two semi frozen yeezys I sold
@ADYMofficial @BoostGoddess @stockx @adidas @OhItsTeddy @wex1200 Agree with you 100%
@stockx Thx for clarifying. Why I continue business with you
"@kangchoi @stockx The credibility is that it is against our financial interests to reject a sale. If that's not enough for you, I'm very sorry."
@stockx shits fugly
@Ivan24459478 @stockx That looks like 5 UPS issues to me
"@joshluber @stockx Well then next time, have them show people why they decline the items. Without proof, there is no credibility. It’s like I go out saying “Stockx sells fake shoes” and providing no evidence to back it up and expect people to believe that."
@stockx I never got a tracking code and it’s been a week.
@kangchoi @stockx Nothing to do with that. I just happen to be feel like replying on Twitter today. The Stockx handle won't reply here and neither will CS bc your issue is over. Product is coming back to you.
"@joshluber @stockx I'm sure. Now with all the watches, bags,clothes,ect. It's gotta be crazy. I have nothing but love for you guy's. Always great experiences with stockx👍👍🌲🕎🌲✌"
"@joshluber @stockx Also, I’ve sent two emails to explain this issue further since yesterday.  No response whatsoever. Then I reply on your twitter where people can see it then you respond with in minutes. Just typical."
"@kangchoi @stockx Sorry. That's the process.  Again, we have no reason to reject so obviously we felt it was a legit issue. Also, you were charged shipping, not the 15% fee."
@joshluber @stockx Show me a proof that it is defective. Saying it is is defective is one thing but you are not providing me enough proof to back up decision. Also I was charged 15 dollars.
@joshluber @stockx I'll give you that. Half of my sales were delayed on the way to you due to the carrier.
@kobeporsche @stockx We are looking for someone who is a Palace expert. Tell them to email jobs@stockx.com
@sneakerbink @stockx Black Friday / Cyber Monday / Holidays. Yeezy is a small part actually
@DeadStockOnlySF @stockx This is Black Friday/Cyber Monday but will extend all holiday season. Many issues are related to UPS delays in shipping and scanning
"@kangchoi @stockx It's not in our best interest (CS or $) to reject a sale so while I apologize for not sending a pic, you can be sure that its legit. This is evidence of an honest company, one which errs on not shipping a buyer a defective product. Also, you weren't charged any fee"
@jdoesntcook @YzyPreme @stockx Yuh
@joshluber @stockx My guy!!! Did we we just become best friends? YUP
@zmoney_hookem @stockx Emory
"@djpaceone @stockx Yep. We are aware that UPS is having a lot of issues, including delays in scanning and shipping."
@joshluber @stockx Oh you’re in the club??? From where?? We are a rare bunch
@djpaceone @joshluber @stockx all my trackings are like this right now.
@Math_amigo_ppp @stockx It’s a trip man. It makes little to no sense to me
@Ajretroking @stockx u sold that for cheap!
@stockx remove the stockx fee until you resume to normalcy
"This shoe is too underrated, shoutout @stockx for the cop! https://t.co/R3cAJ0Behm"
@stockx Yeah ik it’s expected
@zmoney_hookem @stockx I only reply to other JD/MBAs
"@stockx @joshluber 43 perfect sales since 5/2016, always A class service. 👍 I have 3 transactions pending, no worries. https://t.co/dvQnJsSI9b"
Everytime I order from @stockx I get the slowest shippers who take all the time allotted n then some. I never get those quick shippers. 😞🤷‍♂️
@stockx That is a lot of 2004 Roc Forces. Sure the sellers don’t have them confused with the 2017 version? https://t.co/lWGYsGI270

@joshluber @stockx @joshluber It’s not the delays in funding I’m concerned W/ I can wait on the $. But I have canceled sales and am being told my items are late but tracking to you is either not scanned or delayed. Example below. No need to respond just look into it. I know you guys are workin hard https://t.co/F0uRe79cQk
@stockx When all this are resolve can you please have a day with no trasaction fee? We need to sell our bricks before christmas. Thanks 👊🙏❤️
"@joshluber @stockx My man. I appreciate you actually responding lol, thought it was a long shot"
@zmoney_hookem @stockx Lol done.
"@joshluber @stockx If they fail inspection, can I consider this tweet as binding? Sorry, just the lawyer in me."
"@zmoney_hookem @stockx All good. Feel free to resell it on Stockx. We will pass that defect thru 100 out of 100 times. No guarantee the next one won't have a glue stain or something worse. It could be perfect, too. My point is just that we hold ourselves to same standards as Nike"
"@joshluber @stockx Let me sleep on it and weigh my options. Thanks for the help, Josh. A man of the people ✊🏻"
@joshluber @stockx Thankfully this one checked out ✔️
@joshluber @stockx Thanks!!
@Nkicks77 @stockx But people put our tags on fakes all the time...
@Nkicks77 @stockx Yes both came from Stockx
@stockx 👀
@zmoney_hookem @stockx Honestly nothing. It's a $190 retail shoe that is mass manufacturered for $50.  That is 100% normal. I have plenty of shoes which have way worse defects right from Nike.
@joshluber @stockx What would you do if you were in my position and just paid 7x retail?
@stockx Seller has shipped the shoes. Wondering if he forgot to report it into the app?
@zmoney_hookem @stockx FYI Slight manufacturer defects are acceptable at Stockx
I just listed an Ask for the adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Beluga 2.0 on @StockX https://t.co/Ylc3ZJMa59
"@zmoney_hookem @stockx That looks like pretty minor manufacturers defect to me. I wouldn't do anything if it was me. But if you want support to double check that it's legit, feel free to email support@Stockx.com."
@joshluber @stockx Lol i know that but my friend bought the off white am 90 w the tag already on It and we’re trying to determine if it’s real by the stockx tag
@SneakerGeex @stockx Tru
@Nkicks77 @stockx If it came from StockX it's legit.
@stockx @joshluber can you please help?

@qneff @stockx Nope! Just looking out for the ppl that do
@joshluber @NikeFiend927 @originalgongsta @stockx @djayDoe This is very important @joshluber I am hoping my 2nd pair is the complete package. I have yet to hear anyone receiving their pairs form Nike without some laces.
@msaidov01 @stockx Same
@c_stephens5150 @stockx Do you have any orders with them right now?
@stockx @joshluber which of these tags are currently being used/ are authentic? https://t.co/dW1QzyIFgE
"@mikeyzee @stockx @yzy_l @M0001aster That sucks that you were that upset, but we have very little tolerance for people who use chargebacks egregiously. Feel free to email the chain to me josh at Stockx dot com and I'll look into it"
"@djpaceone @stockx Given normal delays in UPS shipping, order processing, customer support emails and payouts, there is nothing to worry about a Nov 25 sale not paid out yet. Everyone is working around the clock to catch up. We greatly appreciate your patience."
@DavisPtd26 @stockx Huh?
@JoystickGenius @stockx Packages usually can't be rerouted once in transit but Support will help however else they can. Any delay in replying is currently due to holiday traffic. They are working around the clock to catch up. We greatly appreciate but I promise we will help get your shoes to you
@djpaceone @stockx @joshluber frrrrr same my yeezys i shipped out is in detroit and stuck there  i WANT MY MONEY
@stockx Add palace!!!!!
"@NikeFiend927 @uhasib @originalgongsta @stockx Yes we are in the process of doing that. We just found out, as well. cc @djayDoe"
@stockx Discount code
@stockx I’m having major problems with them as well. Tracking for sales has been pending for days and never scanned. Sold Nov 25th Payouts late. Not sure if I should ship anymore sold items on Monday. Support is not supportive. @joshluber HELP!!! @stockx is out of control.
@BeastERM27 @stockx What is more intriguing is how UPS works. Have two shipments being sent 5 miles apart from each other and the different journey and processing centers each one goes through. I thought it would be the same for both.
@stockx What about orders from 20 days ago? https://t.co/3qBOWl9LA2
@stockx question- what does the verification QR code actually take you to? Just get a bunch of random numbers. Thanks!
"@ShmadsYoDad @stockx As long as each box has its printed paper slip, individually."
@c_stephens5150 @stockx 😂😂😂😂 yessss
@gsneaks191 @stockx Seems like a good way for your stuff to get taken by the ups man
@joshluber @uhasib @originalgongsta @stockx I think y’all should clarify on the listing that they might not come with the extra laces bcuz buyers are expecting it
"@OhItsTeddy @stockx Chuch! Keep the gear coming out, looks dope"
@BeastERM27 @stockx YS already shipped. Already got 2 out of my 5 from YS. Haven't seen any dramatic changes. Biggest change was after the adidas shipment
If you sold Beluga 2.0 on @stockx I hate you right now https://t.co/FylrLoslOP
@stockx Shipped shoes to u on Monday and ups is taking forever to deliver them to u usually takes 2 days
"@stockx Fking you decline my supreme north face pullover because “too defective from manufacturer” and show me no pictures of the “defect”? So you pretty much do whatever you want, huh. What a dishonest company."
@stockx I sold like 5 pairs can i put them all in one box?
@danielmostes @stockx
@stockx Hopefully your team is learning from this experience and won't be so overwhelmed when the Blue Tints drop.
@stockx Go ahead and give a discount code. Not our problem you can’t keep up with the orders.
@stockx can y'all respond to my email y'all big time unprofessional
@stockx Everyone dumping beluga 2.0 before the YS shipments drop them under 300
@stockx The Yeezy drop threw the place into a tailspin lol
@stockx @colepegula 😤😾😾😾
@stockx Hopefully I get my shoes this week by Thursday cuz I’m going on a cruise and I would like to have them with me 😒
@stockx Too many Beluga 2.0 lmao

@uhasib @originalgongsta @NikeFiend927 @stockx That's great.  FYI I just looked into it...lots of pairs shipping from Nike without extra laces
@stockx can you sell without a lid?
"@stockx Are you guys ""BOEHM""? that's where my package was delivered to"
"@luiswhoelse @stockx He hasn’t got charged as far as I’m aware, and neither have I got refunded or the shoe at the same price."
@bannedGav @stockx He aint get charged that 15% either ? You better off now prices dropped big time.
@luiswhoelse @stockx The thing is the seller hasn’t even shipped the shoes out and it’s been 2 days. If the seller did it would be understandable
@J_Cowboys @stockx @UPS Same sent out 3 packages on monday. 1 got there yesterday. Another days delivered but no conformation email from stockx &amp; the 3rd is still not delivered. Fucking ridiculous.
@luiswhoelse @stockx @UPS Seller
@J_Cowboys @stockx @UPS You a seller or buyer ?
@bannedGav @stockx UPS has been really really slow.
"Hey @stockx @joshluber your customer service sucks. Never recieved my package (because you switched from USPS to UPS international out of the blue). And ""Russ"" wont answer my emails to help for weeks, even though UPS will re route the package."
@stockx bought beluga 2.0s on 17/11/29 and it’s December 2nd now.  Seller had 2 days to ship and still nothing. Can I get my refund? I already emailed support.
@adidasUS @nikestore @goatapp @stockx @Footaction @footlocker @champssports @Eastbay @Shiekh @ShoePalace etc PLEASE do NOT use @UPSHelp this holiday season or u will have a TON of unhappy furious customers contacting u with complaints about delays! @USPS &amp; @FedEx have NO delays! https://t.co/nXinZRpOaF
@stockx @uhasib @StockXSneakers You guys don’t respond to emails issues I place order for Adidas Pharrell HU package was lost on transit and still waiting for you guys response 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
@stockx Need a mug for retail dm
@stockx let the seller decide which delivery service to use @UPS is slacking big time
@stockx I have some items that need to be shipped by 12/5/2017. They are in the original boxes but the tops have been ripped off (how the shoes are sold at NIKE outlets). Is that still acceptable for sale??

@khills720 @stockx $340
@Ajretroking @stockx Check your payout method and make sure it’s correct. For some reason my payout method was gone off my account (assuming a bug from an app update) and I was waiting days to get paid out before it was recommended for me to check on that
@YourBoyTaki @stockx Very true
@stockx Duhhh what did anyone expect? As soon as 80% of the people who ordered online get theirs it will keep going down. Not up.
i really like @stockx it’s so nice and smooth and easy to buy sneakers on. the shipping is just super slow

@stockx Making me pay $25 more for the shoe. What's happening with you guys??????!!!!!
@stockx Let's work something out cause this is twice in one week. At first I hit buy it now and the purchase didn't go through until the third time
@Matt59393732 @DevilZzZuk @KonugantiSahith @yeezybusta @stadiumgoods @goatapp @flightclub @stockx Yeah that's what got me looking at them wierd too the back even the sole see how much it raises over the other part of the sole
@stockx thanks for update hope customer understand  and it will be like this for two months. https://t.co/x5rPEgkPtE
@stockx Why is this guy getting so long to ship u the shoes. Not my fault they didn't have them in hand. Usually a fan of @stockx but what's good??
"@stockx Yo! Not worried about the payouts. I  grabbed the shoes over a week ago. Status been saying ""enroute for verification "" the entire time..."
@DevilZzZuk @Starlin_knows @KonugantiSahith @yeezybusta @stadiumgoods @goatapp @flightclub @stockx Your boost has the 3 lines so the boost is legit
@m_ruiz217 @stockx I don't think they accept Ruby's dollars.
@Matt59393732 @Starlin_knows @KonugantiSahith @yeezybusta @stadiumgoods @goatapp @flightclub @stockx Far from white 😂😂😂 been trying to find some cleaning products to keep my bottom sole whitened fresh. https://t.co/uMBEyof0t9

@Matt59393732 @Starlin_knows @KonugantiSahith @yeezybusta @stadiumgoods @goatapp @flightclub @stockx White sole?
@stockx So now what? I’ve emailed. No one has an answer. I want my money.
@DevilZzZuk @Starlin_knows @KonugantiSahith @yeezybusta @stadiumgoods @goatapp @flightclub @stockx Can you send a picture of the sole
@Matt59393732 @Starlin_knows @KonugantiSahith @yeezybusta @stadiumgoods @goatapp @flightclub @stockx Fair enough
"@DevilZzZuk @Starlin_knows @KonugantiSahith @yeezybusta @stadiumgoods @goatapp @flightclub @stockx I mean they could be real, but looking at the pictures, the dip looks very deep but it could be that you have be wearing them, don’t take my word"
@Matt59393732 @Starlin_knows @KonugantiSahith @yeezybusta @stadiumgoods @goatapp @flightclub @stockx I’ve worn them since March and it’s a Size 10.5 US.
"Who is the idiot on @stockx going wild with the beluga 2.0's in a 12? We get it, you want $410"

@stockx @mikeyzee @yzy_l You’re mentioning multiple people at that
@stockx @mikeyzee @yzy_l This has to be Stephanie. Stock X you would think y’all would be smart enough to keep the specifics off Twitter 🤦🏽‍♂️
@stockx Said payment was released today and still no payment.
@KingFweezTV @stockx Lmao
@stockx i was just about to mail out an order for authentication and noticed under my account sales history the order says cancelled.  what happened?
@stockx Was wondering what was up
@stockx Mine were shipped out today. I fuck with you so heavy @StockX
@humblehumanbean @stockx This man said “peasants.”  😂😂😂
@HartfordBoost @stockx They got two more of my hu trails 🤦‍♂️
"@DevilZzZuk @Starlin_knows @KonugantiSahith @yeezybusta @stadiumgoods @goatapp @flightclub @stockx I am no Yeezy Busta but the back looks a lot wider then other pictures, could be because they have been worn but i have heard to look at the back if they are narrow they are real if they aren’t narrow and very wide then they are fuck but I don’t know"
"@stockx All good, was getting worried that the package was lost."

@stockx @stockx my app says I made a sale but I didn’t receive any email or notification. I emailed support already.
@mikefrank2020 @stockx haha I just tweeted to them. Thanks for the heads up man!
@mikeyzee @M0001aster @stockx Yes it was. The best one from customer support is Russ. Everyone else just goes in loops
@stockx Great another week for my nmds
@stockx Damn it :(
@stockx I received one payout today. Everything else seems be delayed 2-3 days. It’s all good I’m not broke like some of these other peasants.
@stockx I need my yeezy
@stockx Too many belugas!!!!
"@stockx I’ve been trying to buy a pair of trainers from you people for some time now. you people always stop my transaction, finish your review on my account and please respond to my many emails I’ve emailed."

@StockXSneakers @stockx I ordered a pair of shoes from you guys and the box came extremely damaged. Can someone from @stockx dm me plz?
@nnardo01 @stockx Oh yeah i know that. Did other assume adidas just made more pairs?
@stockx You guys are missing the cash cannon !
@yzy_l @M0001aster @stockx Was it Stephanie? Lmao bro I emailed them and she replied! They don’t even have managers over there....
@stockx thank you for making the process of selling my yeezys painless. Got fed up with eBay scam artists. What's even better is that I  got paid the day you received the shoes. I'll be for sure selling on your site again.
@Louie_V__ @stockx You still got? Haha
@23realg4life23 @stockx You haven't seen them?! That's your homework this weekend. Empire is basically the consensus favorite of the films.
@fightinz @stockx What is the difference?

@stockx I hope you guys are not scamming me and send me a fake back. @SneakerNews
@stockx what is the deal with this order that’s been pending since 11/15? https://t.co/Js5mjSdcI0
"@stockx I shipped out a pair of shoes that I sold on Monday 11/27, and it has not been delivered to your location yet. It was originally scheduled for delivery on 11/29, but has been rescheduled twice to 11/30, &amp; now to today 12/1 Is there shipping issues with @UPS at the moment?"
Really? @stockx you guys need to hire someone else to authenticate. https://t.co/8yfVwixAhd
@stockx Maybe now I can cop a pair
@JukeFest @stockx @StockXSneakers They said it was a mistake on their part and it should include all laces. They let me return for a refund and gave me $50 off and free shipping on my next order. So I bought another pair on StockX and ended up saving about $100 😎
@uhasib @stockx @StockXSneakers Did they send you new laces? I've been hearing this happened to a lot of people but I haven't gotten a response to my email yet

@StockXLive @stockx Local pick up in detroit?
"@nnardo01 @stockx Prices gonna take months to climb a bit higher, just look at the creams"
@stockx Need a size 10 for $300 shipped leggo
@undhype @stockx Exactly my point.  See yeezy mafia got y’all fooled cus y’all can’t read. The restock was from adidas canceling 18k orders for bots. So they just restocked the same inventory. No added surplus
@CaioMain @undhype @stockx Nah you right. It was just restocking canceled inventory
@fightinz @stockx 🤔 https://t.co/DgDEeBLaIx
@stockx How about cashing me out on the 12 pairs u have sitting in your warehouse since Tuesday!!!
@undhype @nnardo01 @stockx Ikr there clearly was a restock of the bots and such orders ... am I wrong or missing something
@jevgamer @stockx You get hit with 15%
@basebal2513 @stockx @Lovingkicks_ Bunch of whining ass resellers. Get a job.
@basebal2513 @stockx @Lovingkicks_ Agreed
@stockx OvO timberlands please
@FedExHelp 1800-PICK-UPS @UPS needs help on 2nd day deliveries to @stockx
@nnardo01 @stockx there was a restock tho
@stockx Can you make OVO x Timberland available to sell?
Here we go with @UPS shenanigans again. Shipped a package to @StockX 5 days ago and UPS still hasn’t delivered it yet. Shocker...
@basebal2513 @stockx @Lovingkicks_ The problem is that these kids spend (borrow lol) all their money on a pair and they need money back as fast as possible. Ruins resell
@SnkrBots @stockx @Lovingkicks_ Technically there is in the TOS. But their parents sign them up under the parents name so technically they can use
@basebal2513 @stockx @Lovingkicks_ Problem is people panic if they hold a pair of shoes for longer than an afternoon
@stockx &amp; @UPS @UPSHelp delaying deliveries smh.. @FedEx can help you
@stockx @Lovingkicks_ Cause children are crashing the prices - you need a age limit for stockx
@basebal2513 @stockx @Lovingkicks_ Agree 100%
@stockx Might wanna fix that. https://t.co/ub9rTmYOWt
@stockx Cus if you think about it. If yeezy mafia and whoever didn’t release the supposed “rarity” chart no one would no. No one would try to get rid of their pairs so quick. And they tricked people into thinking it was a restock yesterday so now everyone tripping 😂
@HartfordBoost @stockx Gettin over like a fat rat
"@stockx @Lovingkicks_ Yeah because people on your site undercut out the ass. If everyone just price matched at 450, the market would hold and people's pairs would sell just as fast"
@stockx Yeah because yeezy mafia scared everyone. Lol prices gonna go up. Everyone who flipped quick is bout to take an L
"@stockx If you flipped release day, you're a smart cookie."
#BuyerAlert @garyvee's shoes = awesome. Buying them from @stockx = #worst decision ever. Doubled the price of the shoe through fees and 'taxes' never guy again #ThanksJoshYourCompanySucks #Extra200Dollars https://t.co/sQdn6WBGtH

@stockx What is your customer service number?
Hello @stockx team. Sent another email regarding the fail inspection I mentioned earlier. I hope a right employee sees the message this time and hopefully get a genuine reply. Pictures of the worn shoes sold to me are attached @joshluber (sorry) https://t.co/90h26AKGEf
What the fuck is the hold up with my payout dawg @stockx
@stockx Do a promotion!!
Looks like I’m gonna stop buying/selling from @stockx for a while.  They can’t handle the holiday volume by having UPS hold packages and verified worn shoes as dead stock.  Still waiting on my order and one of my purchases had pebbles on the sole.
@stockx Yet people are still chargin 400😭
"@stockx @xTheSurgeonx Ups is in bad shape now, all packages are delayed nationwide."

@JDMEaston @stockx Please go to retweet and like for free 🛒..
"@stockx Beluga2.0 average at $400 a pair. With your 9% seller fee, that’s $36 per sale. Multiply by 8000 pairs, y’all made $288K just for this shoe alone this past week! Damn y’all ballin! 🤙🏼"
@stockx Disappointing &amp; unprofessional. Hopefully someone in the upper management sees this tweet and get to the bottom of this. Will not recommend StockX to others in the future if I do not get a genuine reply via email from Russ or the team.

@innawesociety @stockx Fuck Italy
@tharealPuffPuff @stockx No
"@stockx Got my 1st reply from Russ. Unexpectedly not so apologetic and blamed most of the faults to the #UPS delivery process. Which doesn’t quite explain the WORN insoles and outsoles 😡 (for anyone wondering, the shoes came worn &amp; smelly like this) https://t.co/CDkDEqdTd4"

"@SamSachan @rehath_1030 @flightclub @stockx @proverbnyc Reasons to sell on @goatapp or @stockx versus @flightclub... #1 fc takes 20% which is highest commission out of all 3. #2 fc controls pricing so no free market and their pricing formula is inconsistent and private. #3 other apps pay immediately, fc takes a week+ for payouts"

"@stockx why we shall not include the original sales receipt if an item gets sold ???
Isn‘t that a good sign of authenticity or proof of purchase at an authorized dealer ? 
Or is it not to upset the dude who paid 🤔"
@stockx So around this time I’d assume?
@stockx Ok
@stockx my order for the beluga 2.0s was cancelled but I never got my refund 👀

@IFEELLIKETEDDY @stockx 👀👀
Made my first @stockx purchase today. Partially to compare it to @goatapp but mostly because of the $20 off. Let’s see what happens.

@sotojose_13 @stockx Ole K in that case maybe the seller slacked off on shipping or something
@SchmitzStephen @stockx ?
"@210Gotkickz @stockx I get that, but i literally jus got the email sayin they received confirmation that the seller has shipped today"
@sotojose_13 @stockx Reading is fundamental
@StockXSneakers @stockx Thanks for helping me make money.......
"@sotojose_13 @stockx 2 days for seller to ship it out, couple of days for stock x to get it, then couple days to verify authenticity, then they ship it out. A week sounds about right."
@MidwestSole @stockx You serious? I just sent some today
My @stockx app simply doesn’t let me log in on my iPhone X. it logs me out immediately. Uninstalled and re-installed but nothing. Been waiting for an update but nothing. What’s going on? Been weeks!
"Bought mophie off @stockx last Friday, and seller jus shipped today  thought there was a 2 day shipping period ?🤨🤨🤨"
UPS being trash this time of year is the worst. It shouldn’t take almost 5 days to get packages from Indianapolis to Detroit. I’m about to start just driving shoes straight to @stockx. I hope that’s cool.
if you fast delivery dont go on @stockx takes so long
@stockx I cant wait

@Basicbillie @ahmdubstep @Benunger02 @theyeezymafia @adidas @stockx Yeah.. It's not exactly bidding..Say I'm selling my shoes for 400..and I'm the lowest asking price.. Well you can make an offer or if you think the price is low enough just buy. Its not one ebay where you're going against a bunch of other bidders.
@Basicbillie @Louie_V__ @Benunger02 @theyeezymafia @adidas @stockx Well you can also do buy now on stockX and goat
@Louie_V__ @ahmdubstep @Benunger02 @theyeezymafia @adidas @stockx Bidding scares me and it’s all in dollars where as stadium goods is in pounds 😂
@Basicbillie @ahmdubstep @Benunger02 @theyeezymafia @adidas Yes but they're prices are much higher than say... @stockx . I think it's because they don't have a bidding process like stock X where people compete against each other to see who can sell for the lowest lol
@stockx have it so we can sell palace on stock x

@Brianlepro @beatsbytom @ItsMeCompaa @mixremusic @drackmuse @theyeezymafia @stockx Yeah after everyone realizes they’re going to take an L the price goes back up. I’m sure it’s only going up through the night! The best time to buy is when they announce the restock or during the splash page when the price is the lowest!

"@TheDukeNGS @coryrtincher @NGSDetroit @Vincent_Ellis56 @stockx Stop right there, Dion. Does this guy know you’re tweeting at him from two different accounts? You’re continuing to use Lee Atwater “Boogie Man” political tactics on people."
@coryrtincher @NGSDetroit @Vincent_Ellis56 @stockx You are wrong in some ways and not others. I think your reasoning as to way you think we hate MLS is wayyyyy off base. But everyone is entitled to their opinion.
"@TheDukeNGS @NGSDetroit @Vincent_Ellis56 @stockx Look man, what you do is totally your preogative but I️ clearly can’t say enough that I️ love what you guys have built. You are passionate supporters &amp;great fans. But because I have a different opinion than you based on my experience as a fan and willing to share it, I’m wrong?"

@Theo6777 @jabrowntv @stockx @Sneakersnstuff no bad decisions :) enjoy the eqts!
@jabrowntv @stockx @Sneakersnstuff Word i just checked its actually about the same as the white 93/17’s i just got lol i thought it was more then that for some reason. Sizing wise compared to the OG’s are they the same? I wear 11.5 in those but 11 in ultra boost so what u think?
@jabrowntv @Theo6777 @stockx @Sneakersnstuff bait resale super weak lol.
I lowkey regret buying from @stockx  smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
@Theo6777 @stockx @Sneakersnstuff I think resell isn’t that high for the Bait. Reasonable.
@bkantha1 @stockx ubiq?
"@jabrowntv @stockx @Sneakersnstuff Yeah the Black OG is more expensive then the white, thats y i got them instead. The ultra boost tongue design is perfect &amp; the best in the game, thats why i like the Bait that much more.. &amp; their market value held up for the most part which is a good, and bad thing for me lol"
"@stockx this ""damaged"" to you? https://t.co/8i5vznQHOA"
@bkantha1 @stockx wipe sole with wet tissues
Hey @stockx can you add a worn once at in-store pickup section?
@Theo6777 @stockx @Sneakersnstuff Blk OG is super dope. Classic 93/17. Bait is cool bc there’s no burrito tongue. It’s more like an ultra boost. Thicker pk
@stockx is it considered as a damaged box? https://t.co/C5jwLQkyQZ
"@sanchezaj15 I’ve done some vids analyzing yeezy launches using the @stockx platform you should check out. Like others, you’ll be more confident / empowered when making these decisions."

"No longer recommend buying from @stockx, honestly used to think the ease of placing a bid and just waiting was great. But it’s been 11 weekdays (not counting thanksgiving) since i purchased and the shoes still haven’t shown up to them."
"@stockx aye so umm I sold my Yeezy’s that come in Friday, but the shipment is due Thursday. Is there anything I can do?"
@stockx @UPSHelp Other two package hit departure scan. That 1 package has no tracking info as of now.
It’s just a matter of time until @stockx will screw you over and just leave you hanging. Those stories you hear are true...happened to me yesterday! BEWARE!
"@DavidTjiephoto @BOOSTLINKS Bro if you tryna pay $380, hit up @stockx in a week 😆"

"@stockx I need your help! I’ve sold plenty of sneakers and I’m currently about to send off my first Supreme item, it says include accessories, does that mean bag and stickers? Will I be penalized if I don’t have?"
@DannybSZN @XpeepeepoopooX @stockx lmao i don't think i've ever heard a good thing about stock X😂😂 i've never sold or bought there tho because it's too expensive from canada
@stockx is my promo code from Black Friday automatically applied upon purchase or is there somewhere I need to put it
"@XpeepeepoopooX @stockx @goatapp Same thing happened with my calabasas, came scuffed and leather apart from shoe I emailed them with pictures and asking for my money back and they also said “looks just fine from our view” haven’t bought a shoe from @stockx since."
@stockx Do you pay after the authentication or after someone buys it?
@stockx @DannybSZN @XpeepeepoopooX Looks fine. If you plan to wear the shoes why’s it matter? If your looking to hold you should buy privately and ask for actually pictures of the shoes
@stockx @DannybSZN @XpeepeepoopooX There are clear scuffs and dirt on sole...

"@stockx Hello team. I recently had a sale, got an email about fraud, and got another sale confirmed a few minutes later. Basically have the same sale confirmed second time around. I should ship it if the second sale is still on my page, yes? Thanks!"
@stockx Hello. I received my pair of Pharrell Nmd sun glow sneakers today. But the sneakers are missing the extra pair of laces. This in my opinion violates your terms of new/intact shoes I was promised when I purchased them. Please fix the issue
"@HiddenTigerClaw @stockx def, and people actually really want to cop these to wear, unlike yebras which was primarily to sell - hence the low prices. so theres plenty of demand... bc of this, smart ppl are probably buying up pairs for 400 and will sit on them for a year. great investment."
"@stockx So many ppl are getting in for resell with the idea of pots of gold at the end of the yeezy rainbow. This is the worst time for that. Now, they get their 1 or 2 pairs &amp; panic immediately bc they thought they won the lottery. The market is upside down &amp; this is 1 of the factors."

Hi @stockx Please sort out your customer service. You have generic names like ‘Steph’ and ‘Ari’ (not even real people?) sending generic copy/pasted emails who don’t answer the question stated in the email. I had to ship without a response as it takes so long for responses. (1/2)
@stockx 🔥
"@stockx I thought they were ugly at first, but honestly they grew on me and I really want a pair."
"@stockx It's useless, get the eqt 93/17 has the same aesthetic with 1/5 of the cost"
@stockx 🤢🤮
@stockx it’s just for the name. If it didn’t have ‘yeezy’ it would sit
@stockx Trash
@stockx absolutely 100% disgustingly ugly
@klay88 @stockx Right? Looking like some New Balances....

"@stockx Its pretty ugly, but every one has there own style."
@stockx FUGLY
@stockx I like Kanye but his shoes are ugly. Hate to disappoint the hypebeast out there but the regular yeezy look like karate shoes with an inner tube sown on. These are Velcro straps away from being in Payless. #saveyourmoney
"@stockx Got a size 9 , lmk"
@stockx 🚮
@Skoolie300 @stockx The shoe retailed at 300 tho
@stockx Prolly the reason Nike didn’t wanna give him full creative control
@stockx Ugly
@stockx Take the yeezy name off and it sits on a Walmart clearance rack
@stockx They really look like a pair of jet skis...
@stockx Looks like Kanye is trying to find out how to make people buy his kicks despite how ugly they are.
@stockx Looks like a shoe meant for elementary school kids
@stockx Ugly!!!
@stockx Skechers ripping off Balenciaga
@stockx fugly but comfy
@stockx Too hyped. If I was a 50 year old dad with bad joints I may consider to be some what stylish 😂😂😂☝️
"@stockx I’m not a dad, but I NEED A PAIR!"

"@trunxs0605 @goatapp @goatsupport @stockx Oh and on top of that their Black Friday contest, which they run a couple times through out the year is actually customer focused unlike stockx making you buy something to get into their contest."

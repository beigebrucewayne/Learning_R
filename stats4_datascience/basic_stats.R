# Meausres of central tendency

  # mean - sum of all obs / # of obs
  # median - middle obs in any number of obs
  # mode - number that appears most

# Measures of dispersion

  # range - max value - min value
  # variance - (summed squared of each obs - mean) / n - 1
    # s^2 = E(x - x(bar))^2 / n - 1
  # standard deviation - square root of variance

# normal dist - ( -1.9% | -14% | -34% || MEAN || +34% | +14% | + 1.9% )

# z - score - how many sd's obs is from mean
  # z = (Xi - X(bar)) / s (std dev)

# covariance - spread of two variables
  # covar - E(Xi - X(bar))(Yi - Y(bar)) / n

# correlation - strength & direction - covar of X & Y / std of X * Y
  # p = covar(x, y) / SxSy

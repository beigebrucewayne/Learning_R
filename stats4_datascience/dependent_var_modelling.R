# Deterministic vs probabilistic equations

# Deterministic is algebraic ( y = mx + b )
  # Profit = Revenue - Expenses

# Stats is probabilistic equations
  # Y = a + bXi + e
    # Y = dependent var (sales, units, transactions)
    # a = constant / intercept
    # X = some indepdent var (price, advertisingm, seasonality)
    # b = coeff or slope
    # e = random error term

# ordinary regressino - dependent var depends on movement of one or more indpendent variables (plus error term)

# correlation - strength & direction
# r-squared - measured of shared variance

# standard error - estimate of std dev | std dev / square root of # of obs

# t-ratio - coeff / std error
  # if t-ratio > 1.96 ( 95% confidence interval), var is significatn


# modelling elasticity 

# elasticity - % change in an output variable given % change in input variable

# Using regression model
  # price coeff * avg price / avg quantity (units)
  # Elasticity = Bp p(bar) / q(bar)

# elastic demand - place on demand curve where change in input var produces more than that change in input variable
# inelastic demand - place on demand curve where change in input var produces less thatn that change in output var

if elasticity < |1.00| # demand inelastic
if elasticity > |1.00| # demand elastic

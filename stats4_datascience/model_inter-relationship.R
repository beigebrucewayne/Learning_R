# inter-relationship techniques understand how variables interact together

# segmentation - sub-dividing population into similar sub-markets
	# homogeneous within and heterogeneous between

# 3 uses of segmentation
	# finding similar members
	# make modelling better
	# use marketing strategy to attack each segment differently

# Marketing research - learning WHY. Segmentation as rationale for behavour.
# Marketing strategy - targeting by product, price, promotion and place. Strategy uses the marketing mix by exploiting segment differences.
# Marketing communications - messaging and positioning. One size doesn't fit all, different segments need different messaging.
# Marketing economics - imperfect competition leads to price makers. Right product, right price, right time, right channel = nearly monopolistic power.

# Four P's of strategic marketing

# Partition
	# apply segmentatio algorithm to divide market into sub-markets

# Probe
	# additional data
		# created vars, tend to be around velocity, (time between purchase, share of products penetrated, seasonality, consumer confidence)

# Prioritize
	# financial analysis of resulting segments
		# most profitable, growing fastest, require most effort to keep or cost to serve
		# find customers not worth pursuing

# Position
	# using all above insights + appropriate message


# Criteria for actionable segmentation

	# Identifiability - segment has to be identifiable. Scoring database with each customer having a probability of belonging to each segment
	# Substantiality - each segment needs to be substantial enough to make marketing to it worthwhile
	# Acessibility - way to get to them via marketing efforts
	# Stability - segment membership should not change drastically
	# Responsiveness - segmentation must drive responses

# Managerial judgements for segmentation
	# usage, profit, satisfaction, size, growth
	# a univariate approach to what is a multivariate problem

# Most important customer metric? 
	# number of purchases, rev, visits, etc..

# Profiling
	# show means of each KPI by segment
	# indexes - take each segment's mean / total mean

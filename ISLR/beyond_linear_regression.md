# Moving Beyond Linear Regression

#### Polynomial Regression

Extends linear model by adding extra predictors, does so by raising predictors to a power.



#### Step Functions

Cut range of variable K into distinct regions to produce qulalitative variable.

#### Regression Splines

Dividing range of X into K distinct regions. Within each region polynomial function is fit to the data. Polynomials are constrained so that they join smoothly at each region boundary.

#### Smoothing Splines

Minimizing residual sum of squares criterion subject to smoothness penalty.

#### Local Regression

Similar to spines, but regions are allowed to overlap.

#### Generalized Additive Model

Extend methods above to deal with multiple predictors.

#### Question: How do I estimate CLTV? How do I know what increases value? How can I increase value of a lower tiered customer?

#### Solution: Survival & Tobit Analysis

##### Historical LTV:

1. Uses historical data to sum up each customerâ€™s total revenue.
2. This sum then has subtracted from it some costs: typically cost to serve, cost to market, cost of goods sold, etc.
3. This net revenue is then converted into an annual average amount and depicted as a cash flow.
4. These cash flows are assumed to continue into the future and diminish over time (depending on durability, sales cycle, etc), often decreasing arbitrarily by, say, 10 per cent each year until they are effectively zero.
5. These (future, diminished) cash flows are then summed up and discounted (usually by weighted average cost of capital) to get their net present value (NPV).
6. This NPV is called LTV. This calculation is applied to each customer.

##### Survival Analysis -> Use independent variables to change time until purchase
